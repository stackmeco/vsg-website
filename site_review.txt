SECTION 1: OVERVIEW PAGE (/)
================================================================================

[HERO SECTION]
Label: "System Status: Nominal"
Headline: "Engineering verifiable systems for intelligence and value."
Body: "We engineer deterministic systems for Value, Intelligence, and Physical Reality. Bitcoin verifies value; our AI verifies truth. Nothing launches until we verify it with our own balance sheet."

Buttons: "View Pipeline" | "Operational Specs"

Active Cycles Chips: Axiom, Helios, Stackme, Lumina

[STUDIO METRICS SIDEBAR]
Label: "Studio metrics"
- 5 Active projects (In R&D pipeline)
- 2 Founders (Full ownership)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[THE VSG DIRECTIVE SECTION]
Label: "The VSG Directive"

Card 1 - PURPOSE:
Title: "Engineering Verifiable Systems"
Body: "To engineer verifiable systems at the frontier of AI and Digital Assets. We enable the use of new forms of value without compromising ownership or control—reclaiming human attention for higher-value work."

Card 2 - VISION:
Title: "Compounding Productivity"
Body: "A future where digital assets possess the clarity and durability of hard currency. We build for a reality where ownership is absolute, risks are visible, and systems compound human productivity rather than extract from it."

Card 3 - MISSION:
Title: "Verification via Capital"
Body: "To navigate the frontier of AI and digital assets with our own capital as the first customer. We learn in the open and graduate only the systems we have verified with our own balance sheet."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT CYCLES SECTION]
Label: "Current work"
Headline: "Active Development Cycles"
Body: "Five projects in our Pipeline. Axiom is in research; Helios is in internal alpha; Stackme is in architecture. None are currently accepting external capital or users."

[5 Project Tiles - see Pipeline section for details]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[BITCOIN SECTION]
Headline: "Bitcoin is our fuel, not our marketing"
Body Paragraph 1: "We hold Bitcoin as our primary long-term asset. When it makes sense, we borrow stablecoins against it and use those funds for two things: building our Pipeline and sometimes accumulating more BTC."
Body Paragraph 2: "We don't run a public yield product; this is how we fund our own work."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[HOW WE OPERATE SECTION]
Headline: "How we operate"

Value 1 - TRANSPARENCY OVER THEATER:
"Messy truths over polished stories. We label things clearly: idea, prototype, internal only, or ready."

Value 2 - CAPITAL FIRST, NARRATIVE SECOND:
"Our balance sheet is the first test. If we wouldn't run our own money through it, it doesn't graduate."

Value 3 - SMALL, SHARP SYSTEMS:
"One small, understandable tool beats a sprawling, half-finished platform."

Value 4 - EDUCATION AS SELF-DEFENSE:
"We publish what we learn so others can see through hype and understand real trade-offs."

Value 5 - NEXT-FRONTIER MINDSET:
"We care about what's coming — AI agents, new asset forms, digital scarcity — described in today's terms."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[NEXT STEP BLOCK]
"Next: System"
"See how Verified Systems operates day to day."

================================================================================
SECTION 2: SYSTEM PAGE (/system)
================================================================================

[HERO SECTION]
Headline: "How Verified Systems actually works"
Body: "Two founders, one balance sheet, a Bitcoin treasury, and a small set of functions that keep us honest: governance, risk, compliance, finance, treasury, operations, and communications."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[DEFINITIONS SECTION]
Label: "What we mean"
Headline: "Terms we use, defined plainly"

Term 1 - VERIFIABLE SYSTEMS:
"Systems where the rules are visible, ownership is real, and risks don't hide behind complexity. A system is verifiable when you can inspect how it works, understand what you're exposed to, and verify that it does what it claims."

Term 2 - AI:
"Deterministic Intelligence. Systems designed to constrain stochastic models (LLMs) with rigid verification layers, ensuring outputs are auditable, cited, and hallucination-resistant. We build infrastructure that treats AI as a reasoning engine, not a knowledge base."

Term 3 - DIGITAL ASSETS:
"The ability to make digital things genuinely limited and ownable — not just copyable files with licenses, but assets with provable uniqueness and transferable ownership. Bitcoin is the clearest example; we're exploring what else can work this way."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[BITCOIN TREASURY PROGRAM SECTION]
Headline: "Bitcoin Treasury Program"
Body: "We hold BTC on our own balance sheet. When the risk/reward looks reasonable, we borrow stablecoins against a portion of that BTC, using reputable on-chain venues. Those borrowed funds either:"

Bullet 1: "fund development time and infrastructure for our projects, or"
Bullet 2: "let us accumulate more BTC when we believe it's underpriced."

Disclaimer: "This is an internal program. We don't manage anyone else's assets, and we don't offer treasury products."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[FUNCTIONS SECTION]
Headline: "Functions behind the studio"
Body: "Verified Systems is still just two people, but we think in terms of functions so decisions and responsibilities are clear."

Function 1 - GOVERNANCE & RISK:
"How we set thresholds, limits, and 'no's — especially around leverage and new experiments."

Function 2 - COMPLIANCE:
"How we stay aligned with legal and regulatory constraints in the places we operate."

Function 3 - FINANCE & TREASURY:
"How we track every satoshi, loan, and spend, and keep our own books honest."

Function 4 - OPERATIONS:
"How work moves from idea to requirements to architecture to implementation and review."

Function 5 - COMMUNICATIONS & BRAND:
"How we ensure external signal strictly matches internal system state and telemetry — site updates, Thesis posts, and corrections when we get something wrong."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[CHANGELOG SECTION]
- Nov 2025: Initial site launch with Overview, System, Pipeline, Governance, Library, and Contact pages.
- Oct 2025: v1.0 System Architecture released. Pipeline projects documented.

Next: Governance

================================================================================
SECTION 5: GOVERNANCE PAGE (/governance)
================================================================================

[HERO SECTION]
Headline: "Governance, risk & compliance"
Body: "We work at the edge of AI, Digital Assets, and Verifiable Systems. That edge only matters if people can understand the risks and the rules."

[TABLE OF CONTENTS]
- Legal structure
- BTC treasury policy
- Risk governance
- Regulatory stance

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[LEGAL STRUCTURE SECTION]
Label: "Legal structure"
Headline: "How the company is governed"
Body: "Verified Systems Group LLC is a manager-managed Wyoming LLC, foreign-qualified in Massachusetts."

MANAGER CARD:
Title: "Manager" (Final authority)
Body: "Sole Manager with final authority over business affairs. Also acts as CEO and Controller. Has 100% voting power on operational matters."

COO CARD:
Title: "COO" (Day-to-day operations)
Body: "Responsible for day-to-day operations as delegated. Cannot sign contracts, approve major expenditures, or authorize on-chain treasury moves without explicit written approval."

FUNDAMENTAL DECISIONS:
"Fundamental decisions (selling substantially all assets, admitting new members) require unanimous written consent of all members."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[BTC TREASURY SECTION]
Label: "Capital governance"
Headline: "BTC treasury: what it is (and isn't)"
Body: "Our treasury is Bitcoin-first and policy-driven. It is not a DeFi "product" — it's our own balance sheet."

[HOW THE COLLATERAL LOOP WORKS]
1. Post a risk-managed portion of company BTC as collateral in approved, non-custodial lending protocols.
2. Borrow stablecoins at conservative loan-to-value ratio (LTV) (target ~35%, hard cap 50%).
3. Use borrowed funds for operating runway, internal R&D, or selectively accumulating more BTC.

[WHAT WE ARE NOT DOING]
- Offering yield products to the public
- Running a pooled investment vehicle
- Promising returns or fixed income

Note: "This mirrors how some public companies use Bitcoin as a treasury reserve, but at far smaller scale and with more conservative leverage."

[CAPITAL CONTROLS]
Control 1: "Member loans, not mystery money — funds from members are documented loans, not hidden equity"
Control 2: "Distribution waterfall — creditors first, then loan repayment, then (if any) equity distributions"
Control 3: "No unsupervised on-chain moves — every treasury transaction requires a signed Transaction Authorization Record (TAR)"

"No TAR, no transaction."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[RISK GOVERNANCE SECTION]
Label: "Risk governance"
Headline: "How we cap risk before anything touches capital or users"
Body: "We're pre-launch on every project. Governance here is about capping risk during development, not describing a fantasy future state."

[STAGE-GATES]
"Every project moves through defined stages: Idea -> Prototype -> Internal -> Venture. Moving stages requires joint decision from both founders."

[RISK MEMO]
- What can go wrong?
- Max loss we're willing to tolerate.
- How we would shut it down safely.

[PROJECT-SPECIFIC GOVERNANCE]

HELIOS (Internal Alpha):
- Internal only — no external deposits; touches only Verified Systems funds
- Small slice — capped percentage of borrowed stablecoins at any time
- Drawdown limits — pre-defined loss thresholds trigger capital reduction
- Human in the loop — automated execution paired with alerts and manual oversight

STACKME (Architecture):
- Non-custodial by design — user keeps keys; app is a guided interface
- Safety controls are real, not marketing — Safety Slider reduces liquidation risk
- Full regulatory review required before any launch

LUMINA (Specification):
- Verifiable metadata, provenance, and grading
- No promises about returns
- Transparent fees and explicit rights disclosure

UNIQUENESS ENGINE (Research):
- No deployment without clear privacy model
- Explicit consent mechanics required
- Regulatory review for KYC/AML implications before any implementation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REGULATORY STANCE SECTION]
Label: "Regulatory stance"
Headline: "We're not pretending to be 'already regulated'"
Body: "This section explains how we think about regulation before products go live — not compliance theater."

[WHERE WE ARE TODAY]
- US-based LLC with crypto-first accounting (books in Xero, digital asset sub-ledgers via Cryptoworth, specific-identification cost basis for tax reporting)
- Website and Library are informational only — no offers to invest, no live financial products
- Any BTC borrowing is on the company's own behalf, via non-custodial protocols, under internal risk limits

[HOW WE APPROACH PRODUCT REGULATION]
- Jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction analysis — US (FinCEN, SEC/CFTC, state rules), EU/UK (MiCA and related frameworks)
- Non-custodial does not mean regulation-free — reduces some obligations but doesn't eliminate consumer-protection or financial-crime requirements
- AI = high-risk by default — anywhere AI touches lending, identity, or risk classification, we treat it as high-risk (EU AI Act spirit)
- Licensing when required — get licenses, partner with regulated entities, or change the design

[THINGS WE COMMIT TO NEVER DOING]
- We do not offer or sell tokens as investments
- No opaque yield products where you can't inspect the mechanics
- No hidden rehypothecation of user assets
- No routing around sanctions, identity verification (KYC/AML), or geofencing obligations

"These are plain commitments you can hold us to."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[GOVERNANCE CONTACT SECTION]
Headline: "Want to discuss governance?"
Body: "For regulators and compliance teams, we share deeper materials (business plans, architecture diagrams, draft policies) under NDA. For partners working in AI, digital assets, or risk/compliance who see alignment, reach out."
Button: "Talk to us about governance"
