THE VSG DIRECTIVE SECTION (Bento Layout):
Purpose Card:
- Title: "Democratize Leverage"
- Body: "To democratize institutional-grade leverage. We build tools that give individuals the same financial power as banks, without the intermediaries."

Vision Card:
- Title: "Engineered Trust"
- Body: "A future where 'Trust' is an engineered feature, not a gamble. We replace blind faith with cryptographic proof and open code."

Mission Card (Full-width):
- Title: "Verifiable Autonomy"
- Body: "We engineer the infrastructure of autonomy across three critical pillars, ensuring that every system we build is transparent, solvent, and secure."
- Pillars:
  1. Validate Signal - Forcing AI to be deterministic and source-backed (Axiom).
  2. Preserve Value - Merging DeFi safety with HFT speed (Stackme & Helios).
  3. Protect Identity - Proving personhood without surveillance (Uniqueness Engine).

ACTIVE VENTURES SECTION:
- Lists all 5 projects with stage chips
- Links to individual venture detail pages

POWERED BY BITCOIN SECTION:
- Headline: "Powered by Bitcoin"
- Body: "Bitcoin serves as our reserve asset. Rather than liquidating capital to fund operations, we utilize responsible, over-collateralized borrowing. This sustains our long-term balance sheet while funding continuous innovation."
- Closing: "We deploy our own capital first—aligning our incentives with every system we build."

OPERATING PRINCIPLES SECTION (6 Principles, 2-column grid):

1. Intelligence Augmented (IA)
   Quote: "Let the machine compute. Let the human connect."
   Body: "We use AI to amplify human capability. By offloading high-velocity data processing to our Helios engine, we free our team to focus on the things machines cannot do: strategy, empathy, and judgment."

2. Seek the Signal
   Quote: "Verify, then trust."
   Body: "We recognize that narratives are often engineered to obscure reality. We don't rely on blind faith or centralized perception; we engineer clarity through cryptographic proof."

3. Engineered Ambition
   Quote: "Dream in decades, execute in milliseconds."
   Body: "We are building generational technology—from automated capital engines to optical surface scanning—with extreme precision. We embrace big risks by managing them with rigorous, automated safety rails."

4. Own the Engine
   Quote: "Master the mechanics to rewrite the rules."
   Body: "We are a team of architects, not passengers. We require deep financial fluency and a first-principles understanding of how value is created, stored, and protected within our treasury."

5. Value is a Mirror
   Quote: "Serve first, succeed second."
   Body: "We succeed only when our users thrive. We build non-custodial tools that restore power to the user—providing liquidity without selling assets—knowing that true value flows from service, not extraction."

6. Force Multiplier
   Quote: "Level the playing field."
   Body: "Structural asymmetries favor the incumbent. We build leverage for the underdog. We arm individuals with the tools to bypass gatekeepers and access the capabilities usually reserved for massive institutions."

================================================================================
PAGE 2: PROCESS (System.tsx) - Route: /process
================================================================================

META:
- Title: "Process"
- Description: "How we operate: our Bitcoin treasury strategy, functional responsibilities, and the principles that govern our development lifecycle."

HERO SECTION:
- Headline: "How We Operate"
- Body: "A small, focused team backed by a Bitcoin treasury. We separate functions clearly: Risk Management defines limits, Treasury allocates capital, and Engineering verifies every build."

CORE CONCEPTS SECTION (System Primitives):
Eyebrow: "System Primitives"
Title: "Core Concepts"

1. Verifiable Systems
   "Infrastructure that is fully auditable. No black boxes. The rules are visible, the risk is defined, and the outcome is mathematically provable."

2. Deterministic AI
   "Artificial Intelligence that follows rules instead of guessing. It anchors every output to a verified data source, eliminating hallucination."

3. Digital Bearer Assets
   "Assets you truly own, not just IOUs. They can move freely across the internet instantly, without needing permission from a bank or platform."

BITCOIN TREASURY SECTION:
Eyebrow: "Capital strategy"
Title: "Our Bitcoin Treasury"
Body: "Our treasury is built on Bitcoin. When conditions are favorable, we borrow against a portion of our holdings using trusted, non-custodial lending venues. The proceeds either:"
- Fund development and infrastructure for our ventures, or
- Allow strategic Bitcoin accumulation during market downturns.
Disclaimer: "This is an internal program. We do not manage external capital or offer yield products."

FUNCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES SECTION:
Eyebrow: "Functional responsibilities"
Title: "How We're Organized"
Body: "We are a small team, but we maintain clear functional separation. This clarity ensures accountability and reduces operational risk."

Functions (5 cards):
1. Risk Management - "We set strict limits on leverage and exposure. Defined solvency thresholds protect capital across all market conditions."
2. Regulatory Alignment - "We operate within the law. All projects are designed for compliance in the jurisdictions where they may deploy."
3. Treasury Operations - "We track all capital movement with auditable precision—from loan positions to operational expenditures."
4. Development Lifecycle - "Every project follows a structured path from specification through build and testing before deployment."
5. Public Accountability - "What we say externally matches what we do internally. Public documentation reflects actual system state."

PAGE 3: VENTURES (Pipeline.tsx) - Route: /ventures
================================================================================

META:
- Title: "Ventures"
- Description: "Our active ventures: Axiom, Helios, Stackme, Lumina, and Uniqueness. Self-funded projects moving through validated development stages."

HERO SECTION:
- Headline: "Our Ventures"
- Body: "Five projects in active development. Each is self-funded and stress-tested with our own capital before external deployment."

DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE SECTION:
Eyebrow: "Development lifecycle"
Title: "From Idea to Impact"
Body: "Every venture moves through a validated development process. This structure surfaces risk early and ensures we build systems designed for long-term stability."

Stages (5 steps):
1. Define the Problem / Why before How
   "We start with the problem, not the technology. Before any code is written, we validate the business case and define measurable success criteria."

2. Validate the Concept / Risk Reduction
   "Prove viability before building. We use rapid prototyping to test assumptions early—reducing the cost of failure and focusing resources on what works."

3. Build with Verification / Security First
   "Engineering with continuous checks. Automated testing verifies system integrity throughout the build, making security and stability foundational, not afterthoughts."

4. Deploy Incrementally / Controlled Release
   "No big-bang releases. Features roll out in stages, validated under real-world conditions before reaching all users."

5. Iterate with Data / Continuous Improvement
   "Launch is the beginning. We monitor performance and refine continuously based on real usage data."

PAGE 4: STANDARDS (Governance.tsx) - Route: /standards
================================================================================

META:
- Title: "Standards"
- Description: "Our governance framework: how decisions are made, how we manage risk, and our approach to compliance. Transparency over theater."

HERO SECTION:
- Headline: "Our Standards"
- Body: "Trust requires transparency. This page explains how we make decisions, manage capital, and ensure our systems meet both our internal standards and external regulatory requirements."
- Secondary: "We operate at the frontier of AI and digital assets. Clear governance is essential for both partners and regulators to understand how we work."

TABLE OF CONTENTS (Sidebar):
- Legal structure
- BTC treasury policy
- Risk governance
- Regulatory stance

LEGAL STRUCTURE SECTION:
Eyebrow: "Legal structure"
Title: "How the company is governed"
Body: "Verifiable Systems Group LLC is a manager-managed Wyoming LLC, foreign-qualified in Massachusetts."

Manager Card:
- Title: "Manager" / Final authority
- Body: "Sole Manager with final authority over business affairs. Also acts as CEO and Controller. Has 100% voting power on operational matters."

COO Card:
- Title: "COO" / Day-to-day operations
- Body: "Responsible for day-to-day operations as delegated. Cannot sign contracts, approve major expenditures, or authorize on-chain treasury moves without explicit written approval."

Fundamental Decisions Note:
"Fundamental decisions (selling substantially all assets, admitting new members) require unanimous written consent of all members."

BTC TREASURY SECTION:
Eyebrow: "Capital governance"
Title: "BTC treasury: what it is (and isn't)"
Body: "Our treasury is Bitcoin-first and policy-driven. It is not a DeFi 'product' — it's our own balance sheet."

Collateral Loop (3 steps):
1. Post a risk-managed portion of company BTC as collateral in approved, non-custodial lending protocols.
2. Borrow stablecoins at conservative loan-to-value ratio (LTV) (target ~35%, hard cap 50%).
3. Use borrowed funds for operating runway, internal R&D, or selectively accumulating more BTC.

What We Are NOT Doing:
- Offering yield products to the public
- Running a pooled investment vehicle
- Promising returns or fixed income
Note: "This mirrors how some public companies use Bitcoin as a treasury reserve, but at far smaller scale and with more conservative leverage."

Capital Controls (3 items):
1. Transparent funding — all capital contributions are documented with clear terms
2. Priority structure — creditors are paid first, then loans, then any distributions
3. Transaction oversight — every treasury move requires a signed authorization record
Note: "No TAR, no transaction."

RISK GOVERNANCE SECTION:
Eyebrow: "Risk governance"
Title: "How we cap risk before anything touches capital or users"
Body: "We're pre-launch on every project. Governance here is about capping risk during development, not describing a fantasy future state."

Stage-gates Card:
"Every project moves through defined stages: Idea → Prototype → Internal → Venture. Moving stages requires joint decision from both founders."

Risk Memo Card:
- What can go wrong?
- Max loss we're willing to tolerate.
- How we would shut it down safely.

Project-Specific Governance:

Helios (Internal Alpha):
- Internal capital only — no external deposits; operates on VSG treasury exclusively
- Position limits — capped percentage of borrowed stablecoins at any time
- Drawdown triggers — pre-defined loss thresholds activate capital reduction
- Manual oversight — automated execution paired with alerts and human verification

Stackme (Architecture):
- Non-custodial architecture — user retains key control; interface is guidance layer
- Solvency controls — graduated liquidation tranches reduce forced-sale risk
- Regulatory gate — full compliance review required before deployment

Lumina (Specification):
- Verifiable provenance — metadata, grading, and chain-of-custody attestation
- No return guarantees — explicit disclosure of speculative nature
- Fee transparency — all costs and rights disclosed before instrument issuance

Uniqueness (Research):
- Privacy-first — no deployment without explicit privacy model
- Consent architecture — explicit opt-in mechanics required
- Regulatory clearance — KYC/AML impact assessment before any implementation

REGULATORY STANCE SECTION:
Eyebrow: "Regulatory stance"
Title: "Regulatory Posture: Pre-Product"
Body: "Compliance architecture defined before deployment. No products are live; this documents the framework for when they are."

Where We Are Today:
- US-based LLC with crypto-first accounting (books in Xero, digital asset sub-ledgers via Cryptoworth, specific-identification cost basis for tax reporting)
- Website and Library are informational only — no offers to invest, no live financial products
- Any BTC borrowing is on the company's own behalf, via non-custodial protocols, under internal risk limits

How We Approach Product Regulation:
- Jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction analysis — US (FinCEN, SEC/CFTC, state rules), EU/UK (MiCA and related frameworks)
- Non-custodial does not mean regulation-free — reduces some obligations but doesn't eliminate consumer-protection or financial-crime requirements
- AI = high-risk by default — anywhere AI touches lending, identity, or risk classification, we treat it as high-risk (EU AI Act spirit)
- Licensing when required — get licenses, partner with regulated entities, or change the design

Operational Prohibitions:
- No token sales or investment offerings
- No opaque yield products—if you can't see how it works, we won't build it
- No hidden reuse of user assets without explicit consent
- No circumventing sanctions, identity verification, or geographic restrictions
Note: "These constraints are binding. Violations trigger immediate remediation."

CONTACT CTA SECTION:
Title: "Want to discuss governance?"
Body: "For regulators and compliance teams, we share deeper materials (business plans, architecture diagrams, draft policies) under NDA. For partners working in AI, digital assets, or risk/compliance who see alignment, reach out."
