--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[THE VSG DIRECTIVE SECTION]

Card 1 - PURPOSE:
Title: "Engineering Verifiable Systems"
Body: "To engineer verifiable systems at the frontier of AI and Digital Assets. We enable the use of new forms of value without compromising ownership or control—reclaiming human attention for higher-value work."

Card 2 - VISION:
Title: "Compounding Productivity"
Body: "A future where digital assets possess the clarity and durability of hard currency. We build for a reality where ownership is absolute, risks are visible, and systems compound human productivity rather than extract from it."

Card 3 - MISSION:
Title: "Verification via Capital"
Body: "To navigate the frontier of AI and digital assets with our own capital as the first customer. We learn in the open and graduate only the systems we have verified with our own balance sheet."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT CYCLES SECTION]
Headline: "Active Development Cycles"
Body: "Five projects in our Pipeline. Axiom is in research; Helios is in internal alpha; Stackme is in architecture. None are currently accepting external capital or users."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[BITCOIN SECTION]
Headline: "Bitcoin is Reserve, Not Product"
Body: "We hold Bitcoin as our primary long-term reserve asset. We utilize conservative, over-collateralized borrowing to fund R&D, treating liquidity as an operational tool rather than a yield product."
Body 2: "This is internal treasury management. We do not offer external yield products or manage third-party capital."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[OPERATIONAL PRINCIPLES SECTION]
Headline: "How we operate"

1. RAW DATA OVER NARRATIVE
"State is labeled precisely: research, specification, architecture, internal, production. No ambiguity."

2. CAPITAL VERIFICATION
"Internal balance sheet is the first test. Nothing graduates without capital at risk."

3. MINIMAL ATTACK SURFACE
"One well-defined system with clear boundaries. No sprawling, half-verified platforms."

4. OPEN DOCUMENTATION
"Published research enables external verification. Trade-offs are explicit, not hidden."

5. FRONTIER SYSTEMS
"AI agents, bearer assets, digital scarcity — building infrastructure for next-generation primitives."

================================================================================
SECTION 2: SYSTEM PAGE (/system)
================================================================================

[HERO SECTION]
Headline: "How Verified Systems actually works"
Body: "Two founders, one balance sheet, a Bitcoin treasury, and a small set of functions that keep us honest: governance, risk, compliance, finance, treasury, operations, and communications."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[DEFINITIONS SECTION]

Term 1 - VERIFIABLE SYSTEMS:
"Systems where the rules are visible, ownership is real, and risks don't hide behind complexity. A system is verifiable when you can inspect how it works, understand what you're exposed to, and verify that it does what it claims."

Term 2 - AI:
"Deterministic Intelligence. Systems designed to constrain stochastic models (LLMs) with rigid verification layers, ensuring outputs are auditable, cited, and hallucination-resistant. We build infrastructure that treats AI as a reasoning engine, not a knowledge base."

Term 3 - DIGITAL ASSETS:
"The ability to make digital things genuinely limited and ownable — not just copyable files with licenses, but assets with provable uniqueness and transferable ownership. Bitcoin is the clearest example; we're exploring what else can work this way."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[BITCOIN TREASURY PROGRAM SECTION]
Headline: "Bitcoin Treasury Program"
Body: "We hold BTC on our own balance sheet. When the risk/reward looks reasonable, we borrow stablecoins against a portion of that BTC, using reputable on-chain venues."

Disclaimer: "This is an internal program. We don't manage anyone else's assets, and we don't offer treasury products."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[FUNCTIONS SECTION]
Headline: "Functions behind the studio"

1. GOVERNANCE & RISK
"Definition of solvency thresholds, leverage caps, and negative constraints for all treasury and product operations."

2. COMPLIANCE
"Alignment with legal and regulatory constraints across operating jurisdictions."

3. FINANCE & TREASURY
"Tracking of all capital flows, loan positions, and expenditures with auditable precision."

4. OPERATIONS
"Stage-gated workflow from specification through architecture, implementation, and verification."

5. SIGNAL INTEGRITY
"Ensuring external outputs strictly match internal telemetry and system state. No divergence between stated and actual conditions."

================================================================================
SECTION 3: PIPELINE PAGE (/pipeline)
================================================================================

[HERO SECTION]
Headline: "The Pipeline"
Body: "Our R&D projects, tied to our BTC treasury, moving through defined stages. All self-funded. None public yet."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[BTC TREASURY SECTION]
Headline: "BTC treasury: what it is (and isn't)"

[COLLATERAL LOOP]
1. Post risk-managed portion of company BTC as collateral in approved, non-custodial lending protocols.
2. Borrow stablecoins at conservative LTV (target ~35%, hard cap 50%).
3. Use borrowed funds for operating runway, internal R&D, or selectively accumulating more BTC.

[CAPITAL CONTROLS]
1. "Member loans, not mystery money — funds from members are documented loans, not hidden equity"
2. "Distribution waterfall — creditors first, then loan repayment, then (if any) equity distributions"
3. "No unsupervised on-chain moves — every treasury transaction requires a signed Transaction Authorization Record (TAR)"

"No TAR, no transaction."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[PROJECT-SPECIFIC GOVERNANCE]

HELIOS (Internal Alpha):
- Internal capital only — no external deposits; operates on VSG treasury exclusively
- Position limits — capped percentage of borrowed stablecoins at any time
- Drawdown triggers — pre-defined loss thresholds activate capital reduction
- Manual oversight — automated execution paired with alerts and human verification

STACKME (Architecture):
- Non-custodial architecture — user retains key control; interface is guidance layer
- Solvency controls — graduated liquidation tranches reduce forced-sale risk
- Regulatory gate — full compliance review required before deployment

LUMINA (Specification):
- Verifiable provenance — metadata, grading, and chain-of-custody attestation
- No return guarantees — explicit disclosure of speculative nature
- Fee transparency — all costs and rights disclosed before instrument issuance

UNIQUENESS ENGINE (Research):
- Privacy-first — no deployment without explicit privacy model
- Consent architecture — explicit opt-in mechanics required
- Regulatory clearance — KYC/AML impact assessment before any implementation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REGULATORY COMMITMENTS]
- No token sales as investments
- No opaque yield products
- No hidden rehypothecation of user assets
- No routing around sanctions/KYC/AML/geofencing
