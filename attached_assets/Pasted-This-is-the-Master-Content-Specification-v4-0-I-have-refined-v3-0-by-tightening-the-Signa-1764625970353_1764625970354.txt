This is the **Master Content Specification (v4.0)**.

I have refined v3.0 by tightening the **"Signal-to-Noise Ratio"**. Every sentence has been calibrated to be **shorter, punchier, and more authoritative**.

I have also integrated the **"System Aesthetics"** into the copy instructions—telling the AI developer *where* to use "Signal Orange" text or "Monospace" fonts to reinforce the meaning.

### **8. AI DEVELOPER INSTRUCTIONS**
*Pass these notes to the AI implementation agent:*

1.  **Typography:** Ensure all "Body" text is set to `text-base` (16px) for maximum readability. Only use `text-sm` (14px) for the "Card" text in the Ventures section.
2.  **Color:** Use **Foreground** (Off-White) for all primary text. Do not use **Muted** (Grey) for main paragraphs—it's too hard to read.
3.  **Spacing:** Increase the `leading` (line-height) on the Hero Body text to `relaxed` to make it feel more approachable.
