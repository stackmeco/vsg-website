Project: Verifiable-Systems-Group (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, routing via wouter in client/src/App.tsx).

Update the **Insights** page copy so it matches the VSG Brand & Voice System v3.0 (Truth · Capital · Dignity, AI-native, balance-sheet-first).

File: the page used for the Insights route (for example `client/src/pages/Insights.tsx` or similar). Find the component actually rendered for `/insights` and apply these changes there.

Do NOT change layout, components, or routes. Only update text content and any local data structures.

---

1) Hero section

Keep the existing JSX and classes; only change text.

- Overline:
  "Insights from the field"

- Heading:
  "Notes on building verifiable autonomy."

- Body paragraph:
  "We share what we learn as we run Truth, Capital, and Dignity on our own balance sheet first: what worked, what broke, and how we rewired the rails so you don’t have to repeat the same failures."

---

2) Intro / explainer block

If there is an intro text block under the hero, replace its copy with:

"These aren’t press releases. They are working notes, post-mortems, and pattern write-ups from the systems we depend on ourselves. Expect structure, constraints, and evidence—not hype."

If there is no such block, you can add a single paragraph using the existing body-text styles directly under the hero.

---

3) Filters / tags (if present)

If the Insights page has a filter bar, tabs, or tag chips:

- Keep the same UI components.
- Update the **labels only** to:

  - "All"
  - "Truth"
  - "Capital"
  - "Dignity"
  - "Studio updates"

If there is some other filter that clearly overlaps one of these, pick the closest mapping (e.g., “Research” → “Truth”, “Treasury” → “Capital”).

---

4) Post card subtitles (per-article meta)

For the list of posts (cards or rows):

- Do NOT change the data structure (slugs, dates, etc.).
- Where there is a small subtitle or category text on each card, align it to:

  - "Truth" for posts about grading, provenance, AI integrity, or verification.
  - "Capital" for posts about treasury, risk, rails, or balance sheet.
  - "Dignity" for posts about identity, personhood, access, or privacy.
  - "Studio update" for general company / roadmap / meta posts.

If these subtitles are currently free-text, keep them short and swap wording where needed to match one of the four above.

---

5) “What to expect here” section (optional but recommended)

If there is a mid-page explainer section, use your existing section component and replace its content with:

Heading:
  "What to expect"

Three bullets or mini-cards:

1. Title: "From live systems"
   Text:
   "We write from systems we run ourselves, not hypotheticals. If we describe a pattern, it has touched our balance sheet or operations."

2. Title: "Structured, not sensational"
   Text:
   "Each piece starts from a real failure mode or asymmetry, then walks through the mechanics and the fix. No drama, just structure."

3. Title: "Actionable verification"
   Text:
   "Where possible, we include ways to inspect behaviours—logs, specs, or checklists—so you can adapt the pattern without copying our stack."

---

6) Hygiene & brand checks for this file

In the Insights page file only:

- Ensure there are **no** occurrences of:
  - "Signal / Value / Human"
  - "validate the signal"
  - "AI-powered platform", "revolutionary AI", "game-changing agents", "AI magic"
  - casual slang or meme language
- Prefer “people”, “individuals”, “stewards”, or “participants” instead of any generic “the human” phrasing.

Do not touch any other pages or routes in this step.
