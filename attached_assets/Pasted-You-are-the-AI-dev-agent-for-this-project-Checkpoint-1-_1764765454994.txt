You are the AI dev agent for this project.

Checkpoint 1 (global nav + routing) is already implemented. The information architecture and routes are correct, but the recent changes introduced visual and motion inconsistencies:

- Some transitions and animations do NOT match the existing feel of the site.
- New color combinations are hard to read and feel off-brand.
- Some new pages/layouts do not look cohesive with the rest of the site.

Your job now is a DESIGN CLEANUP PASS that restores visual cohesion and readability WITHOUT changing the information architecture.

### HARD CONSTRAINTS (DO NOT BREAK THESE)
1. DO NOT change the nav structure or the set of routes.
2. DO NOT remove or rename any existing pages.
3. DO NOT switch frameworks or major libraries.
4. DO NOT introduce a new color palette or font stack.
5. DO NOT add heavy new animations or page transitions.

### 1. Use the existing design system as the single source of truth

- Find the file(s) where the core design tokens or theme are defined, such as:
  - tailwind.config, theme/tokens file, or global CSS variables.
- Treat the existing brand palette, typography, border radius, and shadows in those files as the **authoritative source of truth**.
- From this point forward, all colors, shadows, and transitions on new pages/components should use these existing tokens/classes.

### 2. Remove / normalize ad-hoc colors

The previous agent likely hard-coded extra colors and gradients.

- Search the codebase for:
  - Hard-coded hex colors (e.g. “#” in JSX/TSX files).
  - Tailwind-style classes like bg-*, text-*, border-* that are NOT part of the original palette.
  - Random gradients (e.g. bg-gradient-to-r from-XXX to-YYY) that weren’t used before Checkpoint 1.

For each offender:
- Replace ad-hoc colors with the closest matching existing theme colors.
- Remove gradients from nav, dropdowns, and content areas unless gradients were already part of the original design language.
- Ensure all text colors have good contrast against their backgrounds (e.g. primary text on primary surface, not low-contrast gray on gray).

Goal: all pages and nav elements should feel like they are using a single, coherent palette.

### 3. Normalize transitions and motion

We want subtle, consistent motion—not a mix of random durations and easings.

- Search for transition-related classes and styles:
  - duration-*, ease-*, transition-*, animate-*, transform, etc.
- For navigation items, dropdowns, and basic UI interactions:
  - Use a single, subtle default (e.g. “transition-all duration-150 ease-out” or whatever matches the existing components).
  - Remove overly long durations (e.g. duration-500+ on small UI hovers).
  - Remove heavy transforms like large translate/scale that don’t match the existing site (e.g. big slides, big scales).
- Do NOT add new page-level transition systems here. Just make micro-interactions consistent and subtle.

Goal: hover states and dropdowns should feel smooth and minimal, matching the rest of the site’s original behavior.

### 4. Make dropdown menus visually match the rest of the site

Focus on the navigation dropdowns that were added:

- Ensure dropdown background color matches the existing “surface” / “card” background color used elsewhere in the site.
- Ensure text color matches the standard body text color.
- Reuse the same shadow/border style as other panels or menus (e.g., existing dropdowns, tooltips, or cards).
- Remove any unique flashy styling (unusual gradients, neon accents, etc.) unless they already existed in the original design.

If there is a pre-existing menu/dropdown/panel component, prefer reusing that style and structure instead of custom styling.

### 5. Ensure all new pages use the primary layout

All the new routes created at Checkpoint 1 should feel like part of the same app.

- Identify the primary layout / page wrapper component used by the original pages (e.g. MainLayout, Layout, or similar).
- Ensure all new pages (Ventures, Approach pages, Studio pages, Insights, Connect) are using this same layout wrapper.
- Normalize:
  - Max-width / content width
  - Vertical spacing between sections
  - Background color

Remove any per-page background hacks or custom wrappers added during routing work that deviate from the main layout.

### 6. Quick readability & contrast pass

- Check that text is never placed on top of busy backgrounds or low-contrast color pairs.
- For navigation and dropdowns, ensure active/hover states are clearly visible but still on-brand (e.g. slight color shift, underline, or subtle background, not low-contrast text).
- Avoid using muted grays for primary content text on dark backgrounds; stick to the primary text token.

### 7. Summary and notes

When you’re done, provide a short summary in comments or in your final response:

- Files modified
- Any new helper components created (if any)
- Any remaining visual TODOs you recommend but did not implement

Again: you MUST keep the current IA and routing intact. Focus only on restoring a cohesive, readable visual and motion system that matches the original feel of the site.
