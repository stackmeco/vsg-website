Project: Verifiable-Systems-Group (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, routing via wouter in client/src/App.tsx).

Goal for this checkpoint

Bring the **Lumina venture detail page** fully in line with VSG Brand & Voice System v3.0 and the Truth · Capital · Dignity model.

Lumina must clearly read as:
- A **Truth** venture,
- AI-native and evidence-backed,
- Infrastructure / rails, not a retail grading company,
- Focused on physics-aware, inspectable grading signals,
- Not a yield product, fund, or consumer marketplace.

Do NOT change layout primitives, visual design, or routes. Only update text content, headings, and small local data structures in the Lumina page file.

---

1) Locate the Lumina venture page

Find the component used for the Lumina detail route, e.g.:

- `client/src/pages/ventures/Lumina.tsx`
- or whatever file is rendered for `/ventures/lumina`.

All changes below apply **only** inside this Lumina page file.

---

2) Update the hero section

Keep the existing hero JSX and classes (overline, h1, paragraph, background, CTA). Replace only the text:

- Overline:
  "Lumina · Truth"

- Heading:
  "Lumina — physics-aware grading."

- Body paragraph:
  "Lumina turns raw card condition into evidence-backed grading signals instead of vibes. It ties each result to measurable inputs so collectors, marketplaces, and insurers can see how a decision was formed instead of guessing."

If the hero has a primary CTA button, keep the component and styling but set the label to something neutral like:

- "Back to ventures"
or
- "View all ventures"

and link it to the `/ventures` route (or whatever route already exists for the ventures index).

No “sign up”, “get graded”, or sales CTAs here—Lumina is infrastructure and rails, not a consumer grading queue.

---

3) “Why Lumina exists” section

Find the first explanatory section under the hero. If one already exists, reuse its structure and replace the copy. If not, create a new section using the same section/typography components used on other venture pages.

Section heading:
  "Why Lumina exists"

Body text (1–2 paragraphs; split into multiple <p> if your component prefers):

  "Grading a card often means shipping it away, waiting, and hoping that a human eye sees what you see. Results can drift between graders, queues get clogged, and decisions are hard to audit later. Lumina exists to turn that process into something inspectable."

  "Instead of relying on a single opaque score, we start from measurable properties—surface, corners, centering, edges—and anchor each output to the data and models that produced it. The goal is simple: if a grade matters, you should be able to see how it was built."

Keep the tone calm and architectural; no hype adjectives.

---

4) “What Lumina is / is not” block

If the page already has a “What it is / what it’s not” pattern, reuse it and just update the text. Otherwise, create a simple two-column or stacked section using your existing info-card component.

Left column heading:
  "What Lumina is"

Left column bullets:

  - "Infrastructure for physics-aware grading signals in the trading card ecosystem."
  - "A Truth-domain venture: anchoring condition to evidence, not to guesswork."
  - "AI-native and human-governed: machine intelligence reads sensor data; people define thresholds, policies, and dispute paths."
  - "A way to make grading behaviours inspectable so different parties can understand and audit them."

Right column heading:
  "What Lumina is not"

Right column bullets:

  - "Not a retail grading queue or standalone grading brand."
  - "Not a marketplace or vault for holding customer cards."
  - "Not a guarantee of prices, returns, or investment outcomes."
  - "Not a black-box model that hides how it reached a result."

Use existing card/grid components and styles; only update headings and copy.

---

5) “How Lumina works (at a distance)” section

Add or update a section that explains mechanics conceptually, without going into protocol names, hardware SKUs, or vendor specifics.

Section heading:
  "How Lumina works (at a distance)"

Short lead paragraph:
  "Lumina treats card grading as a measurement and provenance problem, not just an opinion. It builds a chain from how a card was observed to how its condition was scored."

Then use three mini-cards or bullets (reuse an existing pattern):

1) Title: "Evidence first"
   Text:
   "Lumina starts from measurable properties—surface, edges, corners, centering—and records the observations and transformations used to score them."

2) Title: "AI-native, governed outputs"
   Text:
   "Machine intelligence detects patterns and anomalies in the data; people define which signals matter, how they are weighted, and what happens when something looks off."

3) Title: "Inspectable by design"
   Text:
   "Each output is tied back to the inputs and model decisions that created it, so participants can review the path instead of debating a single number in isolation."

Do NOT:
- Name specific sensor vendors, hardware, or model architectures.
- Mention protocol names, token tickers, or any financial venue.

Keep it conceptual and on-voice.

---

6) “Who Lumina is for” section

Add or update a section that clarifies the intended users at a high level.

Section heading:
  "Who Lumina is for"

Use either bullets or three small cards (whichever pattern already exists):

- "Collectors"
  Text:
  "Collectors who want more confidence about condition before they decide what to ship, insure, or trade."

- "Marketplaces and platforms"
  Text:
  "Marketplaces that need consistent, evidence-backed signals to reduce disputes and price more fairly."

- "Ecosystem builders"
  Text:
  "Ecosystem builders who want grading to behave like infrastructure—documented, repeatable, and auditable."

Keep the scope general; do not mention specific partner names or integrations.

---

7) “Where Lumina fits in VSG” section

Add or update a short section that connects Lumina to the rest of the studio.

Section heading:
  "Where Lumina fits in VSG"

Body paragraph:
  "Lumina is how we prove the Truth side of our work. It runs alongside Helios in Capital and the Uniqueness Engine in Dignity, showing how AI-native systems can make key decisions inspectable instead of opaque."

Optional short list (if there is a list component here already):

- "Feeds our standards for evidence-backed decisions."
- "Provides live data for governance and dispute models."
- "Demonstrates how AI can support, not replace, human judgment."

---

8) Safety & scope disclaimer (bottom of page)

At the bottom of the Lumina page, add a small, muted disclaimer paragraph if the layout supports it (use the same style as the Helios disclaimer—e.g., `text-xs text-muted-foreground`):

  "Lumina is grading infrastructure, not an investment or pricing guarantee. Nothing on this page is investment, legal, or tax advice, and we do not hold or custody customer cards."

One paragraph only; keep it concise.

---

9) Hygiene & brand checks for this file

In the Lumina page file only:

- Ensure there are **no** occurrences of:
  - "Signal / Value / Human"
  - "validate the signal"
  - "AI-powered platform", "revolutionary AI", "AI magic", "game-changing agents"
  - "move fast and break things"
  - "monetize users", "harvest data"
  - "StackMe", "Stackme Holdings", or "VSP" as active brand names
  - generic “the human” phrasing (use “people”, “collectors”, “participants”, “personhood”, or “dignity” instead)

- Ensure Lumina is clearly tied to:
  - The **Truth** domain.
  - “AI-native and evidence-backed.”
  - Infrastructure / rails (not a B2C grading line).
  - Non-custodial stance around physical assets (we don’t run a vault).

Do not touch any other venture pages or routes in this checkpoint.
