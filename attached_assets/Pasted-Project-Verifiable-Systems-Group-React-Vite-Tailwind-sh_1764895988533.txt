Project: Verifiable-Systems-Group (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, routing via wouter in client/src/App.tsx).

Goal for this checkpoint

Refresh the **main Overview / Studio / Home page** (the primary landing page mapped to `/`) so it becomes the canonical expression of the VSG brand:

- Fully aligned with **VSG Brand & Voice System v3.0**.
- Uses the **canon line** and the **Truth · Capital · Dignity** model.
- Speaks in the **Architect / Judge** voice: precise, infrastructural, low-hype, with controlled warmth.
- Clearly positions VSG as **AI-native, cryptography-grounded, internal-first, non-custodial**.
- Provides clean, scannable entry points into **Ventures**, **Approach**, **Process**, **Standards**, and **Insights**.

Do NOT change global theming, layout primitives, or add/remove routes. Only update copy, labels, and any local data structures in the landing page file.

--------------------------------------------------
1) Locate the primary landing page
--------------------------------------------------

Identify the component that renders the main landing route `/` in client/src/App.tsx. It may be named something like:

- client/src/pages/Overview.tsx
- client/src/pages/Studio.tsx
- client/src/pages/Home.tsx

All changes below apply only inside this landing page file.

If the page uses a shared <PageMeta> or similar head/meta component, also update that as described next.

--------------------------------------------------
2) Update PageMeta (SEO + snippet)
--------------------------------------------------

If the landing page uses <PageMeta>, update its props:

- title:
    "Verifiable Systems Group"
- description:
    "Verifiable Systems Group is an AI-native, cryptography-grounded venture studio. We engineer the infrastructure of verifiable autonomy—systems where truth can be inspected, capital stays resilient under stress, and people keep dignity and control."

Keep any existing preloadImage prop unchanged (for example, "/hero-texture.png") unless the project uses a different hero asset.

Do not change component structure or imports; only update the string values.

--------------------------------------------------
3) Hero section – canon line + pain entry
--------------------------------------------------

Keep the existing hero layout (columns, background, texture, etc.). Replace only the text and links.

Overline (small, uppercase, muted):
  "Verifiable Systems Group"

Main heading:
  "We engineer the infrastructure of verifiable autonomy."

Body paragraph:
  "We are an AI-native, cryptography-grounded venture studio that builds systems where truth can be inspected, capital stays resilient under stress, and people keep their dignity and control. Everything we ship runs on our own balance sheet and operations first, so it is infrastructure we rely on—not just ideas we talk about."

If the hero has room for a short secondary line under the main body copy, set it to:

  "You shouldn’t have to trade control for leverage or guess how a system will behave when conditions turn."

Hero CTAs:

- Primary CTA:
  - Label: "Explore ventures"
  - href: "/ventures"

- Secondary CTA (if present):
  - Label: "See how we work"
  - href: "/approach"

Do not change hero layout or component types—only the strings and href targets.

--------------------------------------------------
4) Band: “Three questions at the core”
--------------------------------------------------

Directly under the hero, have or refine a band that introduces the three questions. Use existing section/container components and typography.

Section heading:
  "Three questions we ask about every system"

Intro paragraph:
  "Every venture, tool, or experiment at VSG is held up to the same three questions. If a design fails any one of them, it does not belong on rails other people might rely on."

Then render three compact items (cards, columns, or stacked blocks):

Item 1:
  Label:
    "Truth"
  Text:
    "Can you inspect how this system arrives at its claims—and how it can fail—without being asked to just accept it on trust?"

Item 2:
  Label:
    "Capital"
  Text:
    "Does this design keep value resilient under stress, or does it quietly depend on best-case conditions to look safe?"

Item 3:
  Label:
    "Dignity"
  Text:
    "Does this system let people participate without turning their time, data, or identity into exhaust to harvest?"

Keep these items concise and scannable; do not add long paragraphs here.

--------------------------------------------------
5) Section: “What VSG is”
--------------------------------------------------

This is the primary “about” slice on the landing page.

Section heading:
  "What VSG is"

Body paragraph:
  "Verifiable Systems Group is an AI-native, cryptography-grounded venture studio that runs every pattern on its own balance sheet and infrastructure first. We engineer verifiable systems for capital, identity, and intelligence—systems where behaviors can be inspected, constraints are explicit, and control stays with the people who rely on them."

Underneath, use the existing three-card or three-column pattern (if present) with:

Card 1:
  Title:
    "AI-native studio"
  Text:
    "We design as if machine intelligence is in the loop from day one. AI handles the mechanics—monitoring, patterning, and stress-testing—while people own mandates, ethics, and the veto."

Card 2:
  Title:
    "Cryptography-grounded"
  Text:
    "We anchor flows to proofs, audit trails, and constraints instead of narratives. Verifiability and rollback paths are designed in before slogans and decks."

Card 3:
  Title:
    "Internal-first and non-custodial"
  Text:
    "We route our own operations and capital through new architectures first, favoring non-custodial rails where possible. If a pattern fails early, the blast radius lands on us—not on outsiders."

Do not introduce new layout components; reuse whatever card/column pattern the page already uses.

--------------------------------------------------
6) Section: “Ventures: proofs of how we think”
--------------------------------------------------

Provide a high-level teaser for the ventures; detailed content lives on `/ventures` and the individual venture pages.

Section heading:
  "Ventures: proofs of how we think"

Body paragraph:
  "Each venture is a concrete answer to a problem we have lived ourselves: a treasury that felt brittle, a grade that could not be inspected, or an identity check that asked for too much. They exist to prove that our principles survive contact with real constraints."

Below this, render three venture cards, using existing card components but with the updated text and links:

Card: Helios
  Meta line:
    "Helios · Capital · Venture"
  Tagline:
    "Treasury execution under explicit constraints."
  Description:
    "Helios is our internal execution engine for digital asset treasuries. It focuses on routing positions across approved venues under predefined risk limits, so capital remains resilient under stress instead of drifting into hidden exposures."
  Link:
    Label: "View Helios"
    href: "/ventures/helios"

Card: Lumina
  Meta line:
    "Lumina · Truth · Venture"
  Tagline:
    "Physics-aware grading infrastructure."
  Description:
    "Lumina turns the condition of an asset into evidence you can inspect, not a guess you have to accept. It converts wear, defects, and anomalies into structured signals that can feed grading, insurance, and pricing decisions."
  Link:
    Label: "View Lumina"
    href: "/ventures/lumina"

Card: Uniqueness Engine
  Meta line:
    "Uniqueness Engine · Dignity · Venture"
  Tagline:
    "Personhood without exposure."
  Description:
    "Uniqueness Engine is infrastructure for one-person-one-presence—helping systems distinguish real participants from duplicates and automation without turning identity into surveillance or lock-in."
  Link:
    Label: "View Uniqueness Engine"
    href: "/ventures/uniqueness"

If the layout supports small chips for domains, render:
- A primary chip with the main domain (Capital / Truth / Dignity).
- Optional outline chips for the other two domains.

Do not add new design primitives; reuse existing styling/chip components.

--------------------------------------------------
7) Section: “How we build” – bridge to Approach & Process
--------------------------------------------------

This section ties the landing page into `/approach` and `/process`.

Section heading:
  "How we build"

Body paragraph:
  "We treat systems like infrastructure, not experiments on other people. Every venture moves through a six-stage runway—Define, Validate, Build, Deploy, Evolve, Learn—under explicit guardrails for Truth, Capital, and Dignity."

Underneath, use two small callouts or tiles:

Callout 1:
  Title:
    "Approach"
  Text:
    "See how we design inside constraints, prove patterns on ourselves first, and keep AI in the loop without handing it the mandate."
  Link:
    Label: "Review our approach"
    href: "/approach"

Callout 2:
  Title:
    "Process"
  Text:
    "Walk through the six-stage runway that every venture follows—from first definition to long-term learning."
  Link:
    Label: "View the process"
    href: "/process"

Reuse existing card/tile components; do not create new primitives.

--------------------------------------------------
8) Section: “Governance and standards”
--------------------------------------------------

Short, formal slice that points to `/standards`.

Section heading:
  "Governance and standards"

Body paragraph:
  "Our standards encode what systems at VSG are allowed to do before anyone writes code. They define limits, stewards, and logging requirements so ventures cannot drift into behaviors that look attractive on paper but fail under real conditions."

If the page already has a single “Next step” tile or similar component, configure it as:

- Title:
    "Review our standards"
- Description:
    "See how Truth, Capital, and Dignity are turned into concrete guardrails for ventures, internal tools, and experiments."
- href:
    "/standards"

Otherwise, use a simple muted text block with a link button or text link to `/standards`.

--------------------------------------------------
9) Optional section: “Who we build for”
--------------------------------------------------

Only adjust this if the current layout already has a “who we serve” or “for whom” section. Do not introduce a new large section if it breaks layout.

Section heading:
  "Who we build for"

Body paragraph:
  "We build for people and teams who have already felt the cost of opaque systems—operators, stewards, and founders who need rails they can inspect, not just believe."

If the layout supports short bullets, you can use:

- "Stewards of treasuries who care more about resilience than yield marketing."
- "Builders who need AI in the loop without losing control over mandates and guardrails."
- "Communities that want one-person-one-presence without turning participants into product."

If there is no clean spot for this, skip the section entirely. Core sections are hero, three questions, What VSG is, Ventures, How we build, and Governance.

--------------------------------------------------
10) Bottom “Insights / field notes” callout
--------------------------------------------------

At the bottom of the page (just above the footer), add or refine a quiet CTA into `/insights`.

Section heading (small):
  "Field notes"

Body paragraph:
  "We publish notes from real experiments—what held up under pressure, what failed, and how we adjusted. No theatrics; just mechanics and lessons."

Link:
  Label: "Read insights"
  href: "/insights"

Use existing small-card or link styling; do not introduce new visual primitives.

--------------------------------------------------
11) Hygiene & brand checks for the landing page
--------------------------------------------------

In this landing page file only, ensure:

1) There are **no** occurrences of:
   - The old domains "Signal", "Value", "Human" as domain names.
   - The phrase "validate the signal".
   - Phrases like "AI-powered platform", "revolutionary AI", "AI magic", "game-changing agents".
   - "move fast and break things".
   - Phrases like "monetize users" or "harvest data".
   - "StackMe", "Stackme Holdings", "Stackme app", or "VSP" as active brand names.
   - The vague phrase "the human". Prefer: "people", "participants", "teams", "personhood", or "dignity".

2) You do **not**:
   - Mention specific protocol names, token tickers, bank names, or internal legal-entity wiring.
   - Promise yields, returns, or any capital performance.
   - Present ventures as public funds, offerings, or services.

3) You **do**:
   - Use the canon line in the hero: “We engineer the infrastructure of verifiable autonomy.”
   - Center **Truth, Capital, and Dignity** as the three questions.
   - Emphasize AI-native, cryptography-grounded, internal-first, non-custodial, governed design.
   - Maintain the Architect/Judge voice: calm, precise, infrastructural, with controlled warmth (a small number of “you shouldn’t have to…” style lines, not more than 1–2 on the page).

Do not modify other pages or routes in this checkpoint.
