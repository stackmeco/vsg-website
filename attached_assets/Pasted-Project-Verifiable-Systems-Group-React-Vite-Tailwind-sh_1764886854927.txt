Project: Verifiable-Systems-Group (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, routing via wouter in client/src/App.tsx).

Update the **Helios venture detail page** copy so it matches the new brand and Truth · Capital · Dignity model.

File: the page used for the Helios venture (for example `client/src/pages/Helios.tsx` or a Helios detail component under `/ventures`). If the name is different, locate the component actually used when you click into Helios from `/ventures` and apply these changes there.

Do NOT change layout, components, or routes. Only update text content.

---

1) Hero section (top of Helios page)

Keep existing structure (overline, h1, paragraph, any CTA). Replace only the text:

- Overline:
  "Venture · Capital"

- Heading:
  "Helios — our internal engine for resilient capital."

- Body paragraph:
  "Helios is the execution engine we use to route VSG’s own digital asset treasury under explicit limits. It is non-custodial by design: we keep the keys, we set the mandates, and we feel the stress first, so capital can work without surrendering control."

---

2) Short “What Helios does” section

Locate the first descriptive section after the hero (or create a simple one using existing layout patterns). Use your existing card/column components but swap the text for:

Section heading:
  "What Helios does"

Three short items:

1. Title: "Routes inside guardrails"
   Text:
   "Helios routes positions only inside predefined guardrails, so exposures cannot drift silently. Every change is tied back to a clear mandate and risk envelope."

2. Title: "Non-custodial by design"
   Text:
   "Helios orchestrates flows; it does not take custody of external client assets. It is built for our own balance sheet, with controls that could apply to other stewards later."

3. Title: "Built for shocks, not just sunshine"
   Text:
   "We design Helios around stress, not ideal conditions—assuming volatility, dislocations, and failures. If we cannot describe how it behaves when things break, we do not ship it."

---

3) “How Helios fits Capital” section

Add or update a section that ties Helios explicitly to the **Capital** domain (non-custodial leverage, balance-sheet-first). Use text like this:

Heading:
  "Helios in the Capital domain"

Body paragraph:
  "Capital should be able to work without leaving governed control. In the Capital domain, Helios is how we prove that: it applies conservative limits, transparent routing, and clear rollback paths to our own assets before any pattern is shared."

If you already have a section header for this concept, just replace its body with the paragraph above.

4) Safety & brand checks for this page

On the Helios page file only:

- Ensure there are **no** mentions of:
  - specific protocol names,
  - specific venues or banks,
  - token tickers,
  - LTV numbers or detailed thresholds,
  - any language promising “yield” or “maximize returns”.
- Ensure there are **no** occurrences of:
  - "Signal / Value / Human"
  - "validate the signal"
  - "AI-powered platform", "revolutionary AI", "game-changing agents", "AI magic"
  - "the human" as a generic object (prefer “people”, “individuals”, or “stewards”).

Keep all JSX structure, components, and styling as-is; only change the string literals and section copy.
