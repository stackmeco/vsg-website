Project: Verifiable-Systems-Group (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, routing via wouter in client/src/App.tsx).

Goal for this checkpoint

Standardize **PageMeta titles and descriptions** across all core pages so they:
- Match VSG Brand & Voice System v3.0.
- Use clear, SEO-friendly titles and concise descriptions.
- Reinforce: AI-native, non-custodial by design, balance-sheet-first, Truth · Capital · Dignity.

Do NOT change layout, theming, or routes. Only update the `PageMeta` (or equivalent) props in each page component listed below.

Assumptions

- Each page uses a shared meta component like:

  <PageMeta
    title="..."
    description="..."
    preloadImage="/hero-texture.png"
  />

- If the component is named differently (e.g., `Seo`, `Meta`), keep the component and only swap `title` and `description` strings.
- If a page has no meta component, add one at the top of the JSX (within the same wrapper pattern other pages use).

(If you already have a `PageMeta` here, keep `preloadImage` and just update `title` and `description`.)

---

6) Governance / Standards page (`/standards` or `/governance`)

File: the component for Governance/Standards.

Set:

  <PageMeta
    title="Governance & Standards — Guardrails for Verifiable Systems"

9) Uniqueness Engine venture page (`/ventures/uniqueness` or similar)

11) 404 / NotFound page

If your NotFound page uses `PageMeta`, set:

  <PageMeta
    title="Page Not Found — Verifiable Systems Group"
    description="This route is not wired into the current configuration. Start again from the VSG overview, Ventures, or Insights pages."
    preloadImage="/hero-texture.png"
  />

If it doesn’t currently use `PageMeta`, you can skip adding it, or add it following the same pattern as other pages.

---

12) Hygiene checks for all updated pages

For each of the files above, after updating `PageMeta`:

- Confirm there are **no** `title` or `description` strings that:
  - Use “Signal / Value / Human”.
  - Use phrases like “AI-powered platform”, “revolutionary AI”, “AI magic”, “game-changing agents”.
  - Refer to “StackMe”, “Stackme Holdings”, or “VSP” as active brand names.
- Prefer phrasing that reinforces:
  - “AI-native”, “cryptography-grounded”.
  - “run on our own balance sheet first”.
  - “non-custodial by design”.
  - “Truth, Capital, and Dignity” where appropriate.

After edits, run:

  npm run brand:lint

to ensure no banned phrases remain in these updated files.
