Project: Verifiable-Systems-Group (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, routing via wouter in client/src/App.tsx).

Goal for this checkpoint

Improve accessibility and HTML semantics across the site shell so the experience is robust for keyboard users, screen readers, and assistive tech—without changing the visual design or routing.

Focus on:
- Landmarks (header/nav/main/footer)
- Skip link to main content
- Accessible labels for icon-only controls
- Sensible alt text for images
- Safe external link behaviour

Do NOT change theme tokens, colors, spacing, or component libraries. Only adjust markup, attributes, and small utility classes where needed.

---

1) Add a “skip to content” link in the main layout

File: the top-level layout/shell component that wraps all pages (for example `client/src/components/layout/Layout.tsx`, `SiteShell.tsx`, or similar). This is the component that renders the header/nav and page body together.

Tasks:

- At the very top of the layout’s JSX (inside the outermost wrapper, but before the header/nav), add a visually-hidden-until-focus skip link:

  <a
    href="#main-content"
    className="sr-only focus:not-sr-only focus:fixed focus:top-4 focus:left-4 focus:z-50 focus:rounded-md focus:bg-background focus:px-3 focus:py-2 focus:text-sm focus:shadow"
  >
    Skip to main content
  </a>

- Ensure the main content region on every page has an element with id="main-content":

  - If the layout already wraps page content in a <main> element, add id="main-content" to that <main>.
  - If there is no <main> in the layout yet, wrap the page body in:

    <main id="main-content" className="...existing classes...">
      {children}
    </main>

  Keep all existing classes and structure; just add <main> and id if they’re missing.

---

2) Ensure header/nav/footer use semantic landmarks

Files:
- Header component (for example `client/src/components/layout/Header.tsx`).
- Footer component (previously updated in another checkpoint).

Tasks:

- In the Header component:
  - If the root wrapper is a <div>, convert it to <header> and retain all existing className and children.
  - Ensure the navigation container is a <nav> element (not just a <div>). Keep its classes and children intact.
  - Add aria-label="Primary" to the <nav> element if it doesn’t already have a label:

    <nav aria-label="Primary" className="...existing classes...">
      ...
    </nav>

- In the Footer component:
  - Ensure the root wrapper uses <footer> (not just a <div>), retaining all className and children.

Do not alter any layout classes or content—only the HTML tag names and optional aria-label.

---

3) Make the mobile nav toggle fully accessible

File: the mobile navigation / menu toggle component (for example `client/src/components/layout/MobileNav.tsx` or wherever the hamburger/menu button lives).

Tasks:

- Locate the button that opens/closes the mobile menu (often a hamburger icon).

- Ensure the element is a <button> with:

  - type="button"
  - A descriptive aria-label that reflects state, for example:

    <button
      type="button"
      aria-expanded={isOpen}
      aria-label={isOpen ? "Close navigation menu" : "Open navigation menu"}
      className="...existing classes..."
    >
      {/* icon */}
    </button>

- If the icon is purely decorative (e.g., <MenuIcon />), ensure it either:
  - has aria-hidden="true", OR
  - is treated as decorative via the icon component’s own props.

Do not change the visual design or behaviour; just ensure the button and state are labelled for assistive tech.

---

4) Ensure all interactive elements are actual buttons/links

Scope: throughout client/src/components and client/src/pages.

Tasks:

- Search for clickable elements that look like:

  - <div onClick={...}> or <span onClick={...}> used as a button or link.
  - Any non-interactive tag with role="button" or role="link".

- For each:

  - If it navigates to another route or URL, convert it to a <Link> (from your router) or <a> element, keeping all classes and content.
  - If it performs an action (opens a modal, toggles a panel, etc.), convert it to a <button type="button"> with the same classes and children.

- Ensure every <button> has type="button" unless it is intentionally a submit button inside a <form>.

Do not change what these elements do; only choose the correct semantic element and keep styles.

---

5) Image alt text and decorative textures

Scope: all <img> and Image components in client/src.

Tasks:

- For purely decorative background/texture images (e.g., hero textures, abstract patterns):
  - Set alt="" (empty string) to remove them from the accessibility tree.
  - Ensure they do not also have aria-label or title.

- For meaningful images (e.g., logos, venture illustrations used to convey meaning):
  - Ensure alt describes the content or function succinctly, e.g.:
    - Logo: alt="Verifiable Systems Group logo"
    - Venture icon: alt="Helios venture mark" or similar.
  - Avoid stuffing keywords; keep it factual and crisp.

Do not change the source files or classes—only adjust alt props.

---

6) External links safety & clarity

Scope: all <a> elements with target="_blank" in client/src.

Tasks:

- Ensure each such link also has rel="noreferrer" (or rel="noopener noreferrer"):

  <a
    href="https://example.com"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    className="..."
  >
    ...
  </a>

- If an external link text is non-obvious (e.g., “Learn more”), consider adding aria-label that clarifies where it goes, such as:

  <a
    href="https://example.com"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    aria-label="Learn more about Verifiable Systems Group on example.com (opens in a new tab)"
  >
    Learn more
  </a>

Only add aria-label where needed; don’t duplicate purely for the sake of it.

---

7) Hygiene & brand checks (only in files you modify here)

While editing for accessibility in this checkpoint:

- Do NOT introduce:
  - "Signal / Value / Human"
  - "validate the signal"
  - "AI-powered platform", "revolutionary AI", "AI magic", "game-changing agents"
  - "StackMe", "Stackme Holdings", or "VSP" as current brands
  - generic “the human” phrasing; prefer “people”, “individuals”, “participants”, “personhood”, or “dignity” instead.

- Ensure any new text you add is:
  - Calm, precise, and short.
  - On-voice with VSG Brand & Voice v3.0.

After changes, confirm the dev server still builds and that:

- The skip link appears on first Tab and moves focus to the main region.
- You can tab into the nav, open/close the mobile menu, and reach the main content.
- No visual regressions were introduced.
