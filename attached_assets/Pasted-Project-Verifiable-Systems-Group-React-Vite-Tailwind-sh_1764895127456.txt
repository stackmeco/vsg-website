Project: Verifiable-Systems-Group (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, routing via wouter in client/src/App.tsx).

Goal for this checkpoint

Bring the **Approach page** fully in line with:

- VSG Brand & Voice System v3.0
- The Truth · Capital · Dignity model
- The Architect/Judge voice (calm, infrastructural, low-hype)
- The internal-first, AI-native, non-custodial stance

This page should:

- Explain how VSG **thinks about building systems** at a high level.
- Introduce the three questions: **Truth, Capital, Dignity**.
- Summarize the six-stage runway: **Define, Validate, Build, Deploy, Evolve, Learn** and link to `/process` for detail.
- Explain how we use AI (AI-native) and why we run everything on **our own balance sheet first**.
- Clarify what we **will** and **will not** do.
- Connect clearly to `/ventures`, `/process`, `/standards`, and `/insights`.

Do NOT change global theming, layout primitives, or add/remove routes. Only update copy, labels, and local data structures in the **Approach** page file.

--------------------------------------------------
1) Locate the Approach page
--------------------------------------------------

Find the component rendered for the main “Approach” route, for example:

- client/src/pages/Approach.tsx

or whatever file is used for the `/approach` route.

All changes below apply only inside this Approach page file.

--------------------------------------------------
2) Update the hero section
--------------------------------------------------

Keep the existing hero JSX and classes (overline, h1, paragraph, background, CTAs). Replace only the strings and hrefs.

Overline:
  "Approach"

Heading:
  "We treat systems like infrastructure, not experiments on other people."

Body paragraph:
  "Our approach starts with lived failures—assets trapped, signals we could not inspect, systems that treated people as exhaust. From there, we design under clear constraints, run everything on our own balance sheet first, and move ventures through a six-stage runway anchored in Truth, Capital, and Dignity."

If the hero supports a small secondary line, set it to:

  "If a design cannot survive our guardrails, it does not move forward—no matter how appealing the story sounds."

Hero CTAs:

- Primary CTA:
  Label: "Explore ventures"
  href: "/ventures"

- Secondary CTA (if present):
  Label: "See the full process"
  href: "/process"

Do not change hero layout, background, or component types.

--------------------------------------------------
3) Section: “How we approach verifiable autonomy”
--------------------------------------------------

Section heading:
  "How we approach verifiable autonomy"

Body paragraph:
  "We build as if our systems will carry value, decisions, and identities for decades—but we only ship what we can observe, test, and roll back today. Every design starts with a specific failure we never want to repeat, then moves through tightly scoped experiments before it is allowed anywhere near other people’s money, time, or reputation."

If the layout supports bullets or mini-cards under this section, configure three:

Card 1:
  Title:
    "Start from real pain"
  Text:
    "We begin with specific asymmetries we have lived—uninspectable flows, brittle treasuries, extractive identity checks—not abstract opportunity slides."

Card 2:
  Title:
    "Design inside constraints"
  Text:
    "We define the limits first: what must be observable, what cannot be outsourced, and what is off-limits entirely. Ambition is wired through guardrails, not the other way around."

Card 3:
  Title:
    "Prove it on ourselves first"
  Text:
    "We route our own operations and capital through new patterns before anyone else touches them. If a system fails, the blast radius lands on us."

--------------------------------------------------
4) Section: “Three questions we ask about every system”
--------------------------------------------------

Section heading:
  "Three questions we ask about every system"

Intro paragraph:
  "Every venture, internal tool, or experiment inside VSG is held up to the same three questions. If a design fails any one of them, it does not belong on rails other people might rely on."

Then present three items (bullets or cards):

Item 1:
  Label:
    "Truth"
  Text:
    "Can you inspect how this system arrives at its claims—what data it used, how it processed it, and how it can fail? If key behaviors cannot be observed or challenged, they are not acceptable foundations."

Item 2:
  Label:
    "Capital"
  Text:
    "Does this design keep value resilient under stress, or does it quietly depend on best-case conditions? We care as much about exits and degraded modes as we do about normal operation."

Item 3:
  Label:
    "Dignity"
  Text:
    "Does this system treat people as participants with agency, or as exhaust to harvest? People should be able to use the rails without surrendering unnecessary control over their time, identity, or data."

Optional muted line beneath:

  "If we cannot answer all three, we do not ship."

--------------------------------------------------
5) Section: “The six-stage runway”
--------------------------------------------------

This section summarizes the stages and points to `/process` for the deep dive.

Section heading:
  "The six-stage runway"

Intro paragraph:
  "Every venture moves through the same six-stage runway. The goal is simple: surface risk early, keep learning compounding, and avoid shipping anything that we cannot later explain."

Underneath, render a compact version of the six stages (e.g., horizontal steps or a simple grid). Use these names and descriptions:

Stage 1:
  Name:
    "Define"
  Text:
    "Clarify the problem, constraints, stakeholders, and regulatory surface. Decide not just what we might build, but when it should not exist."

Stage 2:
  Name:
    "Validate"
  Text:
    "Run small, low-risk experiments to test the core assumptions with models, prototypes, and simulations instead of full production builds."

Stage 3:
  Name:
    "Build"
  Text:
    "Engineer in short, verifiable increments with automated checks and explicit failure paths so every change is explainable."

Stage 4:
  Name:
    "Deploy"
  Text:
    "Release into a controlled environment with guardrails, observability, and rollback. Launch is treated as a structured experiment, not a cliff jump."

Stage 5:
  Name:
    "Evolve"
  Text:
    "Use live behavior, incidents, and telemetry to refine the system. Ventures either mature into durable infrastructure or are reduced in scope."

Stage 6:
  Name:
    "Learn"
  Text:
    "Run structured post-mortems and feed lessons back into our standards and pipeline so we do not repeat the same mistakes."

Below the grid, add a short CTA line with a link (using existing text-link style):

  "For the detailed version of this runway, see the full Process page." → link to `/process`.

Do not duplicate the entire Process page content here; keep this section concise.

--------------------------------------------------
6) Section: “How we use AI”
--------------------------------------------------

Section heading:
  "How we use AI"

Body paragraph:
  "We are AI-native: we design on the assumption that machine intelligence is in the loop from day one. But AI handles the mechanics; humans hold the mandate. Systems are built so machines scan, simulate, and surface risk, while people define objectives, constraints, and ethics—and retain the veto."

If your layout supports bullets or mini-cards, use three:

Card 1:
  Title:
    "Machines handle the volume"
  Text:
    "High-velocity tasks—monitoring, anomaly detection, scenario runs—are offloaded to machine intelligence so we can see more than any human team could track directly."

Card 2:
  Title:
    "Humans set the rules"
  Text:
    "Targets, thresholds, and trade-offs are set by people, documented in standards, and enforced by code. AI does not invent mandates; it executes under them."

Card 3:
  Title:
    "No closed-loop autonomy"
  Text:
    "Critical paths keep a human veto. If a system could materially affect someone’s money, time, or reputation, there must be a way for a person to inspect and intervene."

--------------------------------------------------
7) Section: “Internal-first and non-custodial”
--------------------------------------------------

Section heading:
  "Internal-first and non-custodial"

Body paragraph:
  "We prove every pattern on ourselves before we point it at anyone else. That includes how capital moves, how truth is established, and how access is granted. We do not pool outside funds, and we do not build systems that require handing us custody to gain leverage."

If layout allows, add a short three-item list:

Item 1:
  Title:
    "Run on our own balance sheet"
  Text:
    "Treasury and financial experiments happen on our capital first. The pain from any early mistakes is ours."

Item 2:
  Title:
    "Control stays with the owner"
  Text:
    "Where we touch capital or identity, we aim for non-custodial designs: you keep keys, you hold proofs, systems orchestrate flows under your rules."

Item 3:
  Title:
    "No hidden dependencies"
  Text:
    "We avoid architectures that quietly rely on a single opaque intermediary. If a system depends on a chokepoint we cannot inspect, we redesign it."

--------------------------------------------------
8) Section: “What we will and will not do”
--------------------------------------------------

Section heading:
  "What we will and will not do"

Use a two-column “Will / Will not” pattern if available.

Left side — “We will”:
- "Run new architectures on our own balance sheet and operations first."
- "Document constraints, failure modes, and rollback paths before launch."
- "Design for verification, not blind trust, across Truth, Capital, and Dignity."

Right side — “We will not”:
- "We will not market yield, funds, or investment products."
- "We will not ask for more data or custody than a system truly needs."
- "We will not ship systems whose behavior we cannot explain under stress."

Muted small-text line:

  "This page describes how we build and operate our own systems. It is not investment, legal, tax, or compliance advice."

--------------------------------------------------
9) Bottom “Next steps” / cross-links
--------------------------------------------------

At the bottom of the page (just above any global footer), add a small “next steps” or cross-link row using existing link or button styles, for example:

- Link 1:
  Label: "Explore ventures"
  href: "/ventures"

- Link 2:
  Label: "Review our standards"
  href: "/standards"

- Link 3:
  Label: "Read field notes"
  href: "/insights"

If the page uses a shared NextStepBlock component instead, configure approximately as:

- Title:
  "See how this approach shows up in the work"
- Description:
  "From treasury to grading and personhood, each venture is a live test of these principles under Truth, Capital, and Dignity."
- href:
  "/ventures"

Use whichever pattern already exists; do not introduce new components.

--------------------------------------------------
10) Hygiene & brand checks for the Approach page
--------------------------------------------------

In the Approach page file only, ensure:

1) There are **no** occurrences of:
   - The old domains "Signal", "Value", "Human" as domain names.
   - The phrase "validate the signal".
   - "AI-powered platform", "revolutionary AI", "AI magic", "game-changing agents".
   - "move fast and break things".
   - "monetize users", "harvest data".
   - "StackMe", "Stackme Holdings", "Stackme app", or "VSP" as active brand names.
   - The vague phrase "the human". Prefer: "people", "participants", "teams", "personhood", or "dignity".

2) You do **not**:
   - Mention specific protocol names, token tickers, bank names, or internal legal-entity wiring.
   - Promise outcomes, yields, or performance.

3) You **do**:
   - Clearly explain the role of Truth, Capital, and Dignity.
   - Reference the six-stage runway with the correct stage names: Define, Validate, Build, Deploy, Evolve, Learn.
   - Emphasize internal-first, AI-native, non-custodial, governed design.
   - Maintain the Architect/Judge voice: calm, precise, infrastructural, with controlled warmth.

Do not modify other pages or routes in this checkpoint.
