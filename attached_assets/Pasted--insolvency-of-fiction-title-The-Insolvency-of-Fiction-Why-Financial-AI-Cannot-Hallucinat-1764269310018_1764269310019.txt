          "Contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) operate on probabilistic engines. They optimize for plausibility, not veracity. While an 80% coherence rate is acceptable for creative generation, it is systemically fatal for financial infrastructure.",
          "A clearing engine settling $10M in Bitcoin cannot tolerate 'creativity.' Standard APIs (like GPT-4) introduce non-deterministic variance into the settlement layer. If an autonomous agent cannot distinguish between a confirmed transaction hash and a predicted one, it cannot act as a fiduciary.",
          "We determined that building 'Helios' (our treasury engine) on raw model outputs would create unacceptable counterparty risk. Without a mechanical governor, the model's ability to hallucinate becomes a solvency vector."

        paragraphs: [
          "We are engineering 'Axiom' not to compete with general-purpose reasoning models, but to constrain them. Axiom treats the LLM as a semantic processor, not a knowledge base.",
          "The system enforces a 'Citation-or-Silence' protocol. It forces the model to query cryptographically verified internal ledgers or legal documentation, retrieve specific data blocks, and construct answers exclusively using that retrieved context.",
          "Crucially, Axiom inhibits the model's ability to bridge gaps with fabrication. If the verified data is absent, the system is engineered to fail silently rather than invent a plausible lie. In high-stakes finance, a 'null' response is infinitely superior to a false positive."

          "We are entering an era of infinite synthetic media and zero-cost content generation. In this environment, verifiable truth transitions from a commodity to a scarce asset class.",
          "By linking our financial verification (Bitcoin/Helios) with our semantic verification (Axiom), VSG is architecting a closed loop: systems that can mathematically prove what they own, and structurally verify what they know.",
