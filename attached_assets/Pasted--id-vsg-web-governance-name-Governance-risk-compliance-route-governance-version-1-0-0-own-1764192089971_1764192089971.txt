# Governance, risk & compliance

## 1. Why this page exists

We work at the edge of AI, Bitcoin and digital scarcity. That edge only matters if people can understand the risks and the rules.

This page explains **how Verified Systems is actually governed today**:  
who decides what, how we treat our Bitcoin treasury, and how we’re thinking about regulation and compliance as we move projects from R&D to reality.

> **Brand usage on page:**  
> First mention: “Verified Systems (Verified Systems Group LLC, ‘VSG’)”  
> Then: “Verified Systems” or “VSG”.

## 2. How the company is governed

### 2.1 Legal structure & authority

Verified Systems Group LLC (formerly Stackme Holdings LLC) is a **manager-managed** Wyoming LLC, foreign-qualified in Massachusetts. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

- **Manager:**  
  - **Andrew Warlow** – sole Manager with final authority over business affairs. He also acts as CEO and Controller. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **COO / Non-managing member:**  
  - **Benjamin Morton** – COO responsible for day-to-day operations as delegated by the Manager. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

**Decision rights (plain language):**

- Andrew has **100% voting power** on operational matters. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Ben can run operations but **cannot**:
  - sign contracts,  
  - approve major expenditures, or  
  - authorize on-chain treasury moves  
  without explicit written approval from Andrew (via a Transaction Authorization Record). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Certain “fundamental decisions” (e.g., selling substantially all assets or admitting a new member) require **unanimous written consent** of all members. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

> **Design note:** Show this as a simple diagram:  
> “Verified Systems Group LLC → Manager (Andrew) → COO (Ben) → Shared Services (GRC, Finance, Ops, etc.)”.

## 3. Treasury & capital governance

### 3.1 BTC treasury: what it is (and isn’t)

Our treasury is **Bitcoin-first** and policy-driven. It is not a DeFi “product”; it’s our own balance sheet.

We use a **collateral-and-borrowing loop**:

1. Post a **risk-managed portion** of company BTC as collateral in approved, non-custodial lending protocols.  
2. Borrow stablecoins against it at a **conservative LTV** (e.g., target ~35%, hard cap 50%). :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
3. Use those borrows for:
   - operating runway,
   - internal R&D (Helios, stackme, Lumina, Uniqueness Engine),
   - selectively accumulating more BTC when conditions make sense. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  

We are **not**:
- offering yield products to the public,
- running a pooled investment vehicle,
- promising returns or fixed income.

This mirrors how some public companies have used Bitcoin as a treasury reserve (e.g., MicroStrategy’s BTC strategy), but at a far smaller scale and with more conservative leverage.   

### 3.2 Capital controls

To keep this honest and auditable:

- **Member loans, not mystery money.**  
  Any funds advanced by members are treated as **Member Loans** by default, not equity, unless explicitly documented otherwise. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  

- **Distribution waterfall.**  
  Cash flows go in strict order:  
  1. Third-party creditors  
  2. Interest + principal on Member Loans  
  3. Only then, if any, equity distributions. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  

- **No unsupervised on-chain moves.**  
  No automated or on-chain treasury activity can occur without a **Transaction Authorization Record (TAR)** signed by the Manager. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  

> **UI idea:** a small “How we move money” callout card with a 3-step flow and a line:  
> “No TAR, no transaction.”

## 4. Risk governance (today, not fantasy)

We’re still pre-launch on every project. Governance here is about **how we cap risk before anything touches material capital or users.**

### 4.1 Studio & pipeline controls

For every project in the Pipeline (Helios, stackme, Lumina, Uniqueness Engine):

- **Stage-gates:**  
  - Idea → Prototype → Internal → (maybe) Venture  
  - Moving stages requires a joint decision: Andrew (risk/treasury) + Ben (ops/product).  

- **Risk memo for each stage:**  
  - What can go wrong?  
  - Max loss we’re willing to tolerate.  
  - How we would shut it down safely.

- **Balance-sheet test:**  
  Nothing graduates to “Venture” until we’d trust it with **our own capital for the long haul**, which directly reflects your mission.  

### 4.2 Helios (internal, early-development)

Helios exists—on paper and in architecture—as an **internal DeFi strategy**, not a public product. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  

Governance rules (intended, and **must** be implemented before real size is deployed):

- **Internal only.** No external deposits; it can only touch funds owned by Verified Systems. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- **Small slice.** Only a capped percentage of borrowed stablecoins may be allocated to Helios at any time. (E.g., single-digit % slices while in early runs; exact numbers live in an internal risk policy.) :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- **Drawdown limits.** If performance or system issues trigger pre-defined loss thresholds, capital must be reduced or pulled. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
- **Monitoring, not blind automation.**  
  Automated execution is paired with alerts; a human remains in the loop for significant changes or shutdowns. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  

Copy note for users:

> “Helios is in early-stage development and is used, if at all, only with our own capital and tight limits. It is not available to customers or outside investors.”

### 4.3 stackme, Lumina, Uniqueness Engine

These projects have **clear requirements and architecture defined**, but no public launch.

We anchor them on principles already written into the stackme plan: non-custodial design, safety-forward UX, and education > hype.   

- **stackme (BTC credit app concept)**  
  - Non-custodial by design; user keeps keys; app sits as a guided interface to underlying protocols. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}  
  - Safety Slider / Safety Rails concepts are **controls**, not marketing tricks. They must be implemented to reduce liquidation risk, not to push users into risky leverage.   
  - Any launch requires a full regulatory review and clear disclosures about risk.

- **Lumina (RWA trading cards)**  
  - Governance focus: verifiable metadata, provenance and grading; no promises about returns.  
  - Any marketplace functionality must be transparent about fees, rights, and lack of guarantees.

- **Uniqueness Engine (identity research)**  
  - Early research only. No identity system gets deployed without a clear privacy model, explicit consent mechanics, and a regulatory review for KYC/AML implications.

## 5. Regulatory & compliance stance

We’re not pretending to be “already regulated.”  
This section spells out how we think about regulation **before** products go live.

### 5.1 Where we are today

- Verified Systems runs as a **US-based LLC** with a crypto-first accounting posture: books in Xero, digital asset sub-ledgers via Cryptoworth, and specific-ID cost basis for tax reporting. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}  
- The website and Library are **informational only**:  
  - No offers to the public to invest.  
  - No live financial products open to consumers yet.  
- Any BTC borrowing is done **on the company’s own behalf**, via non-custodial protocols, under our internal risk limits. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}  

### 5.2 How we’ll approach product regulation

For any future launch (stackme, Lumina, Helios-derived tools):

- **Jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction analysis.**  
  - US: FinCEN, SEC/CFTC, state lending/consumer rules depend on final design.  
  - EU and UK: MiCA and related crypto frameworks, especially if we ever serve EU residents. MiCA, for example, creates a harmonized regime for crypto-asset issuers and service providers (e.g., custodians, exchanges, stablecoin issuers), with additional clarity still emerging for truly decentralized protocols.   

- **Non-custodial, but not “regulation-free.”**  
  The stackme plan already bakes in a non-custodial architecture: user-owned wallets, DeFi under the hood, and Stripe handling fiat KYC/AML. That reduces some obligations but does **not** eliminate consumer-protection or financial-crime requirements.   

- **AI = high-risk by default.**  
  Anywhere AI touches lending, identity, fraud detection or risk classification, we treat it as “high-risk” in the spirit of the EU AI Act: subject to documented risk management, data governance, transparency and human oversight.   

- **Licensing when required.**  
  If a product clearly lands in a regulated bucket (e.g., money transmission, lending, investment advisory), we will either:
  - get the appropriate licenses,  
  - partner with a regulated entity, or  
  - change the design until it’s appropriate for our scale.

We use the stackme plan’s own tone as a guide: *compliance-conscious, no buzzwords, no hype*. :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}  

### 5.3 Things we won’t do

Plain commitments you can hold us to:

- No tokens sold to the public as “investments.”  
- No opaque “yield” products where you can’t inspect the mechanics.  
- No hidden rehypothecation of user assets (if we ever custody any).  
- No routing around sanctions, KYC/AML, or geofencing obligations.

## 6. Communications, education & change-log

### 6.1 Education as self-defense

Your original stackme plan already encoded this: *“Education over hype: an informed user is an empowered user.”* :contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}  

On the governance page, we make that explicit:

> We publish what we’re learning in the **Library** — from macro frameworks like the Monetary Divergence Thesis to post-mortems on pipeline experiments — so people can see how our views and systems evolve.

### 6.2 Public change-log

Link to a simple table in **/library** that tracks:

- Treasury policy changes (e.g., LTV caps, protocol allowlists)  
- Major governance updates (e.g., adding a director, new risk limits)  
- Status of key projects (e.g., “Helios stress-testing started”, “stackme closed beta paused/revised”).

This is your **“we don’t move the goalposts quietly”** section.
