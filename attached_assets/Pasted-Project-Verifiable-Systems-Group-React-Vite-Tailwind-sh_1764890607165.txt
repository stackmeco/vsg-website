Project: Verifiable-Systems-Group (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, routing via wouter in client/src/App.tsx).

Goal for this checkpoint

Bring the **Ventures index page** fully in line with VSG Brand & Voice System v3.0 and the Truth · Capital · Dignity model.

The Ventures page should:

- Present VSG as a focused, internal-first venture studio (not an incubator or fund),
- Clearly group Helios, Lumina, and Uniqueness Engine under their domains,
- Make it obvious these are proofs run on VSG’s own balance sheet first,
- Avoid any implication that these are public products, funds, or yield programs.

Do NOT change layout primitives, visual design, or routes. Only update text content, headings, and local data structures in the Ventures page file.

---

1) Locate the Ventures index page

Find the component used for the Ventures list route, for example:

- `client/src/pages/Ventures.tsx`
- or whatever file is rendered at `/ventures` in `client/src/App.tsx`.

All changes below apply **only** inside this Ventures index page file.

---

2) Update the hero section

Keep the existing hero JSX and classes (overline, h1, paragraph, background, CTAs). Replace only the text.

- Overline:
  "Ventures"

- Heading:
  "Where we prove the rails."

- Body paragraph:
  "We are a focused venture studio. Helios, Lumina, and Uniqueness Engine are where we run our ideas against real conditions on our own balance sheet first—across Truth, Capital, and Dignity."

If there is a primary CTA in the hero:

- Primary CTA label:
  "See how we work"
  → Link to `/approach` (or keep the existing href if it already points to the approach page).

If there is a secondary CTA:

- Secondary CTA label:
  "Review governance"
  → Link to `/standards`.

Keep all button components, icons, and styles; only update labels and hrefs where needed.

---

3) Define or update the ventures data structure

If this page uses an array like `const ventures = [...]` to render cards, update it to:

- Explicitly map each venture to its domain,
- Use copy consistent with the updated venture detail pages.

Example shape (adjust to match your existing structure/props):

  const ventures = [
    {
      id: "helios",
      name: "Helios",
      domain: "Capital",
      badge: "Helios · Capital",
      tagline: "Resilient capital engine.",
      description:
        "The internal execution engine that routes VSG’s own digital asset treasury under explicit limits so capital can work without surrendering control.",
      href: "/ventures/helios",
    },
    {
      id: "lumina",
      name: "Lumina",
      domain: "Truth",
      badge: "Lumina · Truth",
      tagline: "Physics-aware grading.",
      description:
        "Infrastructure that turns card condition into evidence-backed grading signals so decisions rest on measurable inputs instead of guesswork.",
      href: "/ventures/lumina",
    },
    {
      id: "uniqueness",
      name: "Uniqueness Engine",
      domain: "Dignity",
      badge: "Uniqueness Engine · Dignity",
      tagline: "Personhood without exposure.",
      description:
        "Infrastructure for proving that one person is present without forcing them to hand over their life story, raising the cost of bots and duplicates.",
      href: "/ventures/uniqueness",
    },
  ];

Then ensure the card rendering uses:

- `badge` (or equivalent) as the small overline / pill,
- `name` and `tagline` as the title line,
- `description` as the body text,
- `href` for the “View” link or card click.

Keep card layout, iconography, and classes as they are.

---

4) “How we treat ventures” section

Add or update a section under the cards that explains what “venture” means at VSG.

Section heading:
  "How we treat ventures"

Body paragraph:
  "At VSG, a venture is not just a project. It is a system that survives real stress, carries clear guardrails, and earns its place in the portfolio by protecting Truth, Capital, or Dignity better than what came before."

Then add a short bullet list or three small items (reuse an existing list/card pattern):

- "Internal-first"
  Text:
  "We run each venture on our own balance sheet and operations first, under conservative limits."

- "Domain-anchored"
  Text:
  "Every venture has a home domain—Truth, Capital, or Dignity—so we know what it is responsible for protecting."

- "Governed by standards"
  Text:
  "Ventures inherit our governance, risk, and incident standards from day one, not as an afterthought."

No protocol names, tickers, or specific venues here.

---

5) Optional “Who the ventures serve” strip

If the layout supports a short horizontal strip or 3-pill row, add a compact section explaining who benefits from these ventures without sounding like a sales page.

Section heading:
  "Who these ventures serve"

Use a single paragraph or three short blurbs:

Option A – one paragraph:
  "Our ventures are built for people and teams who need systems that do not fail silently: stewards of treasuries, trading card ecosystem builders, and communities that need to keep bots and duplicates out without turning into surveillance systems."

OR, Option B – three blurbs (if you already have a 3-col layout here):

- "Stewards of capital"
  Text:
  "People responsible for keeping treasuries resilient under stress."

- "Ecosystem builders"
  Text:
  "Teams wiring markets, grading flows, and infrastructure that others rely on."

- "Communities and networks"
  Text:
  "Networks that need stronger defences against bots and duplicates without resorting to heavy-handed identity checks."

Keep it high-level; no specific customers or partners named.

---

6) Bottom CTA / next step

Ensure the bottom of the page has a simple next-step CTA using your existing “NextStepBlock” or equivalent component.

Recommended text:

- Title:
  "See how we build and govern"

- Description:
  "Our approach and standards show how Truth, Capital, and Dignity show up in practice."

- href:
  `/approach`
  (or `/process` if your flow is Ventures → Process; choose whichever matches the current layout, but do not add new routes).

Do not change the component or style—only update the props.

---

7) Hygiene & brand checks for this file

In the Ventures index page file only:

- Ensure there are **no** occurrences of:
  - "Signal / Value / Human"
  - "validate the signal"
  - "AI-powered platform", "revolutionary AI", "AI magic", "game-changing agents"
  - "move fast and break things"
  - "monetize users", "harvest data"
  - "StackMe", "Stackme Holdings", or "VSP" as active brand names
  - generic “the human” phrasing (use “people”, “participants”, “stewards”, “collectors”, “communities”, or “dignity/personhood” instead)

- Ensure the page clearly reinforces:
  - VSG as an AI-native, cryptography-grounded venture studio.
  - Truth, Capital, and Dignity as the three domains.
  - Helios, Lumina, and Uniqueness Engine as internal-first proofs, not public funds or grading lines.
  - Balance-sheet-first, non-custodial stance (without naming protocols, venues, banks, or tickers).

Do not touch other pages or routes in this checkpoint.
