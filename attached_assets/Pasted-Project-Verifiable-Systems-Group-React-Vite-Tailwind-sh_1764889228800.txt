Project: Verifiable-Systems-Group (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, routing via wouter in client/src/App.tsx).

Goal for this checkpoint

Do a **global brand hygiene pass** across the frontend to remove any leftover legacy language and align all copy with VSG Brand & Voice System v3.0 (Truth · Capital · Dignity, AI-native, non-custodial, balance-sheet-first).

Scope: Only files under `client/src` (components, pages, layouts). Do NOT touch `docs/brand`, the brand lint script, or config outside the frontend.

---

1) Define banned and discouraged phrases (for this pass)

Use this list as your search basis inside `client/src`:

Hard-banned (must be removed or rewritten):
- "Signal / Value / Human"
- "Signal, Value, Human"
- "validate the signal"
- "AI-powered platform"
- "revolutionary AI"
- "game-changing agents"
- "AI magic"
- "move fast and break things"
- "monetize users"
- "harvest data"
- "the human" (when used generically like “protect the human”)

Legacy brand names (if used as active brand on site):
- "StackMe Holdings"
- "Stackme Holdings"
- "Stackme"
- "VSP "  (with trailing space, if used as a venture/brand, not as a filename/comment about legacy)

Discouraged (prefer rewrite if found in copy):
- "hypergrowth"
- "maximise yield" / "maximize yield"
- "it just works"
- any casual meme/bro language like "hey guys", "real talk", emojis

---

2) Global search inside `client/src`

For each `.tsx`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.js`, `.mdx`, `.md` file under `client/src`:

- Search for each hard-banned phrase.
- When you find one, **rewrite the sentence or phrase** to align with v3.0 brand. Use these mapping rules:

  - Any “Signal / Value / Human” or “Signal, Value, Human”
    → remove and, where needed, replace with “Truth, Capital, and Dignity”.

  - “validate the signal”
    → replace with something like “anchor decisions to evidence” or “ground the decision in verifiable inputs”, depending on context.

  - “AI-powered platform”
    → “AI-native infrastructure” or “AI-native venture studio” or “we use machine intelligence as part of the mechanism”, depending on context.

  - “revolutionary”, “game-changing”, “AI magic”
    → strip these entirely; replace with calm, precise descriptions of what the system does (e.g., “infrastructure-grade”, “verifiable”, “explicit guardrails”).

  - “move fast and break things”
    → “move fast inside guardrails” or remove and emphasise governed experiments instead.

  - “monetize users”, “harvest data”
    → replace with “align incentives”, “reduce extraction”, “return leverage to the edge” or similar ethical framing, if it’s our stance. If used to describe bad actors, make that explicit.

  - Generic “the human”
    → rewrite to “people”, “individuals”, “participants”, “personhood”, or “dignity” depending on context (“protect people’s dignity”, “protect personhood”, etc.).

  - “StackMe Holdings”, “Stackme Holdings”, “Stackme” as current brand:
    → replace with “Verifiable Systems Group (VSG)” unless the context is explicitly talking about history/legacy (there should be no such legacy context on the public site).

  - “VSP ” as a brand or venture:
    → replace with “VSG” if it refers to the studio, or “Uniqueness Engine” if it’s clearly the uniqueness/anti-duplicate venture. If the context is ambiguous, neutralise to “this infrastructure” or “the system” instead of creating a new name.

- For “discouraged” phrases, adjust wording to be calmer and more precise (e.g., swap “hypergrowth” for “long-horizon, resilient growth”).

---

3) Keep docs and comments safe, but tidy obvious brand drift

- It’s fine to update **inline comments** that still talk about old pillars (e.g., “…maps Signal/Value/Human to cards”). Update them to “…maps Truth/Capital/Dignity to cards”.
- Do NOT touch:
  - `scripts/brandLint.js` itself (except we already updated it in a prior checkpoint).
  - Any brand v3.0 docs under `docs/brand` (they’re canonical).
- If a comment explicitly documents “legacy behaviour” and is clearly not user-facing, you can leave it, but prefer updating to avoid confusion if it’s simple.

---

4) Align any remaining domain mentions

While you’re editing, also fix any leftover domain references:

- If you see “domains” or “pillars” still referring to three items that are clearly the old set, update them to “Truth, Capital, and Dignity”.
- Make sure any place that maps a venture to a domain uses:
  - Helios → Capital
  - Lumina → Truth
  - Uniqueness Engine → Dignity

This includes small labels, badges, or subtitles on cards/components.

---

5) Quick micro-copy sanity pass (only in files you touched)

In each file you modify:

- Confirm the tone is calm, architectural, and on-voice:
  - No hype, no memes, no casual slang.
  - Preference for short, declarative sentences.
- Where you mention AI, prefer:
  - “AI-native”, “machine intelligence”, or “AI-native systems”,
  - and make it clear that “people define mandates, limits, and veto”.

Do NOT introduce:
- Protocol names,
- venues/banks,
- tickers,
- or yield/return promises.

---

6) Final check (for you after changes)

- Ensure the project still compiles (no syntax errors from string edits).
- If possible in this environment, run:

  npm run brand:lint

  and confirm there are no remaining banned phrases in `client/src`.

This checkpoint is strictly a cleanup/alignment pass; no layout or routing changes.
