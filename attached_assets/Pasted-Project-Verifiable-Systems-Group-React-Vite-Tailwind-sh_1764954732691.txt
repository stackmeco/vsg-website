Project: Verifiable-Systems-Group (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, routing via wouter in client/src/App.tsx).

Goal for this checkpoint

Bring the Helios venture page in line with:

- VSG Identity and VSG Brand & Voice System v3.0
- Truth · Capital · Dignity (three beams) — Helios lives primarily in **Capital**
- Pillars / Process / Standards (three structural layers)
- External safety rules (no protocol names, tickers, venues, or entity wiring)
- Updated language (no “Signal / Value / Human”, no “validate the signal”, no “the human” as a noun)

We want the Helios page to:

- Clearly describe what Helios is: an **internal**, governed execution engine for treasury/capital.
- Make it explicit that Helios runs on **VSG’s own balance sheet only**, not as a product or yield offering.
- Show how it fits into Truth / Capital / Dignity and Pillars / Process / Standards.
- Stay high-level: no implementation plumbing, no protocol/bridge names, no numbers.

Do NOT:
- Change or add routes.
- Change global theming (colors, typography, layout primitives).
- Mention specific protocols, banks, tickers, venues, or LTV numbers.
- Suggest that Helios is a client product, pooled fund, or yield vehicle.
- Use “Signal / Value / Human”, “validate the signal”, “protect the human”, “AI-powered platform”, or hype words like “revolutionary” / “game-changing”.
- Add more than ONE warmth line using “you” on this page.

--------------------------------------------------
1) Locate the Helios venture page component
--------------------------------------------------

1. In `client/src/App.tsx`, find the route that corresponds to Helios. Likely patterns:

   - A route with `path="/helios"` or `"/ventures/helios"`.
   - Component name like `HeliosPage`, `Helios`, or similar.

2. Open the Helios page component file (for example `client/src/pages/Helios.tsx` or `client/src/pages/ventures/Helios.tsx`).

Apply all changes in this spec only to the Helios venture page component.

--------------------------------------------------
2) PageMeta – title + description
--------------------------------------------------

Inside the Helios page component, locate `<PageMeta ... />` and set:

- `title`: `"Helios"`
- `description`: `"Helios is Verifiable Systems Group’s internal execution engine for digital asset treasury—designed to preserve capital under constraints while keeping control non-custodial and behaviours inspectable."`

Keep `preloadImage` and any other props unchanged.

Example:

  <PageMeta
    title="Helios"
    description="Helios is Verifiable Systems Group’s internal execution engine for digital asset treasury—designed to preserve capital under constraints while keeping control non-custodial and behaviours inspectable."
    preloadImage="/hero-texture.png"
  />

--------------------------------------------------
3) Hero section – frame Helios clearly
--------------------------------------------------

In the top hero of the Helios page:

3.1 Overline

Set the overline (small label above the heading) to:

  "Capital · Internal treasury engine"

3.2 Heading (`<h1>`)

Set the main heading to:

  "Helios: governed capital under constraints."

3.3 Hero body copy (two paragraphs)

Replace existing hero text with:

Paragraph 1:

  "Helios is our internal execution engine for digital asset treasury. It exists to preserve capital under clear limits, keep control non-custodial, and make it easier to understand how positions behave under stress before they carry real stakes."

Paragraph 2 (this is the single warmth line for this page):

  "You shouldn’t have to guess how your own capital will behave when conditions change. Helios was built after we felt that uncertainty ourselves."

Keep the existing JSX structure, containers, and Tailwind classes; only update the text nodes.

3.4 Hero CTAs (if present)

If the hero renders primary/secondary CTAs, configure them as:

Primary CTA:
- Label:
    "See our approach"
- `href`:
    "/approach"

Secondary CTA:
- Label:
    "Review our standards"
- `href`:
    "/standards"

Reuse existing Button components / variants; only change labels and `href`.

--------------------------------------------------
4) Section: “What Helios is”
--------------------------------------------------

Find the first explanatory section under the hero that describes Helios. Reuse its layout (e.g., two-column text or a section with bullets).

Section heading:

  "What Helios is"

Body intro paragraph:

  "Helios is the studio’s internal engine for managing and testing digital asset treasury under explicit constraints. It is where we model, route, and monitor positions on our own balance sheet before we promote patterns to long-lived infrastructure."

Below that, add two short lists using your existing list styles:

Label:
  "Helios is:"

Items:

- "An internal execution engine for VSG’s own treasury."
- "Focused on preserving capital and making risk easier to inspect."
- "Built to keep control non-custodial and decisions explainable."
- "Run under the same pillars, process, and standards as any other VSG system."

Label:
  "Helios is not:"

Items:

- "A pooled fund, custodial platform, or yield product for clients."
- "A promise about returns or market performance."
- "A black box; its behaviours and limits must be documented and reviewable."
- "A shortcut around risk management, governance, or controls."

Do not add any technical implementation details, numbers, or venue names in this section.

--------------------------------------------------
5) Section: “Where Helios sits in the studio”
--------------------------------------------------

Add or update a section that connects Helios to the beams and the structural layers.

Section heading:

  "Where Helios sits in the studio"

Short paragraph:

  "Helios lives in the Capital beam, but it depends on the other beams and layers to stay honest. It turns our theories about treasury resilience into day-to-day, governed operations."

Then a simple three-row or three-column list (depending on your existing layout):

Item 1:
  Title: "Capital beam"
  Body: "Helios focuses on how capital behaves—how positions are structured, how limits are enforced, and how shocks are surfaced early instead of hidden."

Item 2:
  Title: "Truth and telemetry"
  Body: "Helios relies on trustworthy data and logs so decisions can be inspected later. We care as much about the explanation for a move as the move itself."

Item 3:
  Title: "Dignity and control"
  Body: "Helios keeps control non-custodial. Capital moves under governed mandates, not opaque promises, and we avoid designs that require handover to third parties."

Use existing card / text styles; do not introduce new visual primitives.

--------------------------------------------------
6) Section: “How Helios runs”
--------------------------------------------------

Add or update a section that describes Helios’ operating model at a high level (no plumbing).

Section heading:

  "How Helios runs"

Body copy (two paragraphs):

Paragraph 1:

  "Helios operates under a set of internal mandates that define what we are optimizing for and what we refuse to risk. Before we change a position, we specify the intent, the acceptable downside, and how we will observe the result."

Paragraph 2:

  "Decisions combine machine intelligence and human oversight. Machines help scan, simulate, and surface patterns; humans own the mandates, constraints, and final calls. Every significant change is tied back to a reviewable record."

If there is an existing bullet list for “features” or “capabilities”, replace its text items with:

- "Runs on VSG’s own balance sheet, not pooled client funds."
- "Pairs simulations and monitoring with human mandates and veto power."
- "Records decisions in a way that can be revisited during audits and post-mortems."
- "Feeds lessons back into our standards and six-stage process."

No protocol, bridge, or product names here.

--------------------------------------------------
7) Section: “Governance and standards”
--------------------------------------------------

Add a section that links Helios explicitly to Standards and Process, without exposing wiring.

Section heading:

  "Governance and standards"

Body copy (one paragraph + short list):

Paragraph:

  "Helios operates under the same standards and six-stage process as any other VSG system. It does not get lighter treatment because it is internal; if anything, it is where we apply our strictest controls."

Bullet list (3 items):

- "Design: clear purpose, defined failure modes, and documented constraints before changes ship."
- "Operation: named stewards, review rhythms, and monitoring proportional to impact."
- "Review: structured incident and post-mortem process that feeds changes back into patterns and playbooks."

You may add a small inline link-style CTA, for example:

- `"Review our standards"` linking to `/standards`
- `"View the six-stage process"` linking to `/process`

Reuse existing typography/CTA components.

--------------------------------------------------
8) Section: “What Helios refuses to do”
--------------------------------------------------

Add or update a callout band that states non-negotiables for Helios.

Section heading:

  "What Helios refuses to do"

Bullet list (4–5 items, each one sentence):

- "Take custody of client funds or market performance as a product."
- "Hide material risk in opaque models or uninspectable integrations."
- "Rely on a single venue, mechanism, or assumption without alternatives."
- "Run critical strategies without documented limits and responses."
- "Ignore incidents or near-misses instead of folding lessons back into the system."

Closing sentence:

  "If a strategy or structure cannot meet these constraints, Helios either runs it in a tightly isolated, experimental way or declines it entirely."

No “you” language here; the only warmth line was in the hero.

--------------------------------------------------
9) Bottom CTA – connect back out
--------------------------------------------------

At the bottom of the Helios page, ensure the next-step CTA points visitors back into the more general content.

If there is a `NextStepBlock` or similar on this page, configure it as:

  <NextStepBlock
    nextPage="Insights"
    description="See notes and memos on how we apply these constraints to real decisions."
    href="/insights"
  />

Do not change the component’s styling; only update its props.

--------------------------------------------------
10) Hygiene pass on Helios page
--------------------------------------------------

In the Helios page file:

1) Remove or replace ANY references to:
   - “Signal / Value / Human” as domains.
   - “validate the signal”.
   - “protect the human”.
   - “AI-powered platform”, “revolutionary”, “game-changing”, “disruptive”.
   - “StackMe”, “Stackme Holdings”, “VSP”.

2) Ensure AI language follows v3 rules:
   - Use: “AI-native”, “machine intelligence”, “Intelligence Augmented (IA)” where needed.
   - Avoid: “magic”, “AI does the rest”, “we sprinkle AI across the stack”.

3) Warmth:
   - Keep exactly ONE warmth line using “you” on this page (the hero paragraph above).
   - Do not add additional “you shouldn’t…” lines elsewhere.

4) Domain terms:
   - When you refer to the beams, use “Truth, Capital, and Dignity” (capitalized).
   - Emphasize that Helios lives in the **Capital** beam but touches Truth and Dignity.

5) Content consistency:
   - Ensure description of Helios matches the Studio and Approach pages at a conceptual level.
   - Confirm that nothing implies client funds, products, or yields.
   - Check spelling and capitalization (e.g., “Helios”, “Verifiable Systems Group”, “AI-native”).

--------------------------------------------------
11) Final QA
--------------------------------------------------

After making these edits, run the dev server and open the Helios page route:

- The hero clearly frames Helios as an internal, governed capital engine.
- “What Helios is” and “Where Helios sits in the studio” are clear and consistent with Studio/Approach.
- “How Helios runs” and “Governance and standards” read as institutional-grade, with no plumbing details.
- The “What Helios refuses to do” band states non-negotiables in plain language.
- The bottom CTA points to `/insights`.
- There are no protocol names, tickers, venue names, or numeric limits.
- There are no remaining references to Signal/Value/Human, “validate the signal”, “protect the human”, or hype phrases.
- Tone matches VSG v3: serious, architectural, ethically explicit, one controlled warmth line, no memes or slang.

Only commit once the Helios page feels like a premium, regulator-safe description of how you treat capital inside the studio.
