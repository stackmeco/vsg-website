Project: Verifiable-Systems-Group (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, routing via wouter in client/src/App.tsx).

Update the **primary Overview / Home page** so it becomes the canonical public entry point for VSG, aligned with VSG Brand & Voice System v3.0 (Truth · Capital · Dignity, AI-native, balance-sheet-first).

File: the page rendered for the root route (`/`) — for example `client/src/pages/Overview.tsx`, `Home.tsx`, or similar. Find the component actually used for `/` and apply these changes there.

Do NOT change layout primitives, styling tokens, or routes. Only update text content and any local data structures.

---

1) Hero section (top of the home page)

Keep the existing hero JSX and classes (overline, h1, paragraph, background, CTA). Replace only the text:

- Overline:
  "Verifiable Systems Group"

- Heading:
  "The infrastructure of verifiable autonomy."

- Body paragraph:
  "You shouldn’t have to surrender control just to get leverage. Verifiable Systems Group is an AI-native, cryptography-grounded venture studio that builds systems for capital, identity, and intelligence—run on our own balance sheet first so you can verify, not just trust."

- Primary CTA button label (if present):
  "Explore the ventures"

- Secondary CTA (if present):
  "How we work"

Keep all existing classes, layout, and button components; swap labels/text only.

---

2) Three domains section (Truth · Capital · Dignity)

Locate the first major section under the hero that introduces domains / pillars. If it still uses “Signal / Value / Human” or a different triad, keep the layout but replace content with this.

Section heading:
  "Three domains we build in"

Three cards:

1) Title: "Truth"
   Body:
   "Truth means decisions rest on evidence, not stories. We anchor key behaviours to provenance and tamper-evident logs so you can see how outcomes were formed instead of guessing."

2) Title: "Capital"
   Body:
   "Capital should be able to work without leaving governed control. In Capital, we run our own treasury through non-custodial rails with explicit limits, observability, and rollback paths."

3) Title: "Dignity"
   Body:
   "Dignity means people keep control over how they appear in systems. We enable proof of presence and eligibility without turning people into products in someone else’s database."

Use the existing card/grid components (just replace titles and body copy). Ensure no legacy “Signal / Value / Human” labels remain here.

---

3) “Why we exist” strip (Purpose-level)

Add or update a short band/section (can be a single column or two-column layout) near the top third of the page.

Section heading:
  "Why we exist"

Body paragraph:
  "Our purpose is to democratize institutional-grade leverage. We build infrastructure that moves power from centralized gatekeepers to the edge, so smaller actors can audit, control, and compound without handing the keys to strangers."

Optional second sentence (if there’s room in the layout):
  "We felt the pain of losing value to opaque custodians and unverified feeds ourselves—so we decided to wire systems that don’t ask for blind trust."

Reuse existing typography and spacing patterns; you don’t need new components.

---

4) “Ventures at a glance” section

Locate the section that lists or previews the ventures (Helios, Lumina, Uniqueness Engine) on the home/overview page. Keep the grid/card layout and links; just standardize the copy.

Section heading:
  "Ventures at a glance"

Per-venture card text:

- **Helios**
  - Overline: "Capital"
  - Title: "Helios — resilient capital engine."
  - Body: "Helios is the internal execution engine we use to route our own digital asset treasury under explicit limits, so capital can work without surrendering control."

- **Lumina**
  - Overline: "Truth"
  - Title: "Lumina — physics-aware grading."
  - Body: "Lumina turns raw card condition into evidence-backed grading signals instead of vibes, tying every result to verifiable inputs you can inspect."

- **Uniqueness Engine**
  - Overline: "Dignity"
  - Title: "Uniqueness Engine — personhood without exposure."
  - Body: "Uniqueness Engine proves one person is present without forcing them to hand over their life story, enabling sybil-resistant participation while keeping dignity intact."

Do not change card links, routes, or images—only the text.

---

5) “How we work” summary strip

Add or update a short “How we work” strip (can be three horizontal bullets or mini-cards) near the middle or bottom of the page.

Section heading:
  "How we work"

Three items:

1) Title: "Balance-sheet-first"
   Text:
   "We wire new rails through our own balance sheet and operations first, so we feel the stress and failure modes directly before anyone else adopts the pattern."

2) Title: "AI-native, human-governed"
   Text:
   "Machine intelligence scans, simulates, and flags anomalies; people define mandates, limits, and veto. AI is part of the mechanism, not the boss."

3) Title: "Non-custodial by design"
   Text:
   "Our systems orchestrate workflows, proofs, and controls. They do not pool client funds or seize keys."

Use existing section / card components; don’t invent new layout primitives.

---

6) Hygiene & brand checks for the Overview/Home file

In the root Overview/Home page file only:

- Ensure there are **no** occurrences of:
  - "Signal / Value / Human"
  - "validate the signal"
  - "AI-powered platform", "revolutionary AI", "game-changing agents", "AI magic"
  - "StackMe", "Stackme Holdings", or "VSP" as active brand names
  - any generic “the human” phrasing; prefer “people”, “individuals”, “participants”, or “personhood/dignity”

- Make sure the page explicitly mentions:
  - “AI-native” (or “AI-native venture studio”)
  - “run on our own balance sheet first”
  - “Truth, Capital, and Dignity” as the three domains

Do not touch other pages or routes in this checkpoint.
