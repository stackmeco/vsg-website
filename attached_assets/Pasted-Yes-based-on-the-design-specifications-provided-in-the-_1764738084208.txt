Yes, based on the design specifications provided in the review files, this is **intentional behavior** for the current design system, but it deviates from standard web practices.

Here is the breakdown of why it looks small and how to fix it if it feels *too* small.

### **1. Why is it small? (The "Control Room" Spec)**

Your current design system (VOS v3.0) explicitly sets the **base font size to 14px**, whereas the standard modern web defaults to **16px**.

  * **Evidence:** In `typography-audit.txt`, the Global Settings are defined as:
    ```css
    html {
      font-family: 'Manrope', sans-serif;
      font-size: 14px; /* VOS v3.0: Professional Grade */
    }
    ```
    [cite_start][cite: 2896]
  * [cite_start]**The Intent:** This was chosen to match the **"Industrial Control Room"** aesthetic[cite: 2, 1591]. Technical dashboards (like Bloomberg terminals or AWS consoles) often use 13px-14px to fit maximum data density on the screen.
  * **The Trade-off:** While it looks "technical" and "high-density," it makes a **marketing website** feel cramped and hard to read, especially for long-form content like the Thesis pages .

### **2. Is this "Normal"?**

  * **For an App/Dashboard:** Yes, 14px is common.
  * **For a Marketing Site:** **No.** Standard readability best practices recommend **16px** for body copy to ensure accessibility and reduce eye strain.

### **3. The Recommendation: "High Clarity" Update**

Since you are receiving feedback that it is too small, you should likely **bump the base size back to 16px**. This will scale every element (buttons, cards, text) up by roughly 14% automatically because your code uses `rem` units.

**How to fix it immediately in Replit:**

**File:** `client/src/index.css`

**Change this:**

```css
html {
  /* ... other props */
  font-size: 14px; /* Current "Dense" setting */
}
```

**To this:**

```css
html {
  /* ... other props */
  font-size: 16px; /* Standard Web Readability */
}
```

**Side Effect:**
[cite_start]By changing the root to 16px, your "Muted" text (metadata) will naturally bump from \~12px to \~14px, which fixes the legibility issues noted in the design review regarding muted text contrast[cite: 2927].

Would you like me to provide a prompt to Replit to execute this "Scale Up" globally?
