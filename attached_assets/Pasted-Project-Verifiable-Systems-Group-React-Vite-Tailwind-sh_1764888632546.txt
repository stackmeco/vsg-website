Project: Verifiable-Systems-Group (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, routing via wouter in client/src/App.tsx).

Update the **Studio / About** page so it becomes the canonical public overview of VSG, aligned with VSG Brand & Voice System v3.0 (Truth · Capital · Dignity, AI-native, balance-sheet-first).

File: the page used for the “Studio” or “About” route (for example `client/src/pages/Studio.tsx` or `client/src/pages/About.tsx`). Find the component actually rendered for `/studio` (or equivalent) and apply these changes there.

Do NOT change layout primitives, styling tokens, or routes. Only update text content and any local data structures.

---

1) Hero section (who we are)

Keep the existing hero JSX and classes (overline, h1, paragraph, background, CTA). Replace only the text:

- Overline:
  "AI-native venture studio"

- Heading:
  "We engineer the infrastructure of verifiable autonomy."

- Body paragraph:
  "Verifiable Systems Group is an AI-native, cryptography-grounded venture studio. We build systems for capital, identity, and intelligence, run them on our own balance sheet first, and only share patterns once they have survived real stress."

If there is a single primary CTA button, keep its style but make the label something on-voice, e.g.:

- "Explore the ventures"

---

2) “What VSG is / is not” block

Right under the hero, add or update a simple two-column or stacked block using your existing section component.

Use this content (keep headings as shown, adapt body to the existing typography):

Left column heading:
  "What VSG is"

Left column body (short paragraph + bullets):

  "Verifiable Systems Group (VSG) is an AI-native, cryptography-grounded venture studio that builds verifiable systems for capital, identity, and intelligence — on our own balance sheet first."

  Bullets:
  - "We design architectures that embed verifiability from the foundation."
  - "We prove them in our own ventures and internal systems before sharing patterns."
  - "We operate under explicit constraints, governance, and rollback mechanisms."

Right column heading:
  "What VSG is not"

Right column body (bullets only is fine):

  - "Not a generic AI startup chasing trends or scale without safeguards."
  - "Not a consultancy selling advice without ownership of the outcomes."
  - "Not a custodial platform, yield product, or DeFi protocol pooling external funds."

---

3) Truth · Capital · Dignity triptych

Below the “What VSG is / is not” block, add or update a three-card section for the domains. Use the same card/grid layout style you used on other pages.

Section heading:
  "Three domains we operate in"

Three cards:

1) Title: "Truth"
   Body:
   "Truth means decisions rest on evidence, not stories. We anchor key behaviours to provenance and tamper-evident logs so you can inspect how an outcome was formed instead of guessing."

2) Title: "Capital"
   Body:
   "Capital should be able to work without leaving governed control. In Capital, we run our own treasury through non-custodial rails with explicit limits, observability, and rollback paths."

3) Title: "Dignity"
   Body:
   "Dignity means people keep control over how they appear in systems. We enable proof of presence and eligibility without turning people into products in someone else’s database."

---

4) Purpose · Vision · Mission section (canonical lines)

Add a section near the middle of the page that surfaces the canonical Purpose, Vision, and Mission. Use your existing section/heading styles and 3-card layout.

Section heading:
  "Purpose, vision, and mission"

Three cards:

1) Card title:
   "Purpose — why we exist"

   Card body (include both the short line and one supporting sentence):

   - Short line:
     "To democratize institutional-grade leverage."

   - Supporting sentence:
     "We exist to dismantle the barriers between individuals and elite financial tools, moving power from centralized gatekeepers to the edge so smaller actors can audit, control, and compound without extraction."

2) Card title:
   "Vision — the world we want"

   Card body:

   - Short line:
     "A future where trust is an engineered feature, not a gamble."

   - Supporting sentence:
     "We are working toward a world where systems are auditable by default, intelligence is anchored to facts, and financial assets work for you without leaving your control."

3) Card title:
   "Mission — what we do"

   Card body:

   - Short line:
     "We engineer the infrastructure of verifiable autonomy."

   - Supporting sentence:
     "We combine cryptography and machine intelligence to validate evidence, preserve capital under non-custodial control, and protect personhood without surveillance."

Keep the copy tight and declarative; do not add hype adjectives.

---

5) “How we work” (balance-sheet-first, AI-native stance)

Add or update a short “How we work” section near the bottom of the page.

Section heading:
  "How we work"

Three bullets or mini-cards:

1) Title: "Balance-sheet-first"
   Text:
   "We wire new rails through our own balance sheet and operations first so we feel the stress and failure modes directly before anyone else adopts the pattern."

2) Title: "AI-native, human-governed"
   Text:
   "Machine intelligence scans, simulates, and flags anomalies; people define mandates, limits, and veto. AI is part of the mechanism, not the boss."

3) Title: "Non-custodial by design"
   Text:
   "Our systems orchestrate workflows, proofs, and controls. They do not pool client funds or seize keys."

6) Hygiene & brand checks for this file

In the Studio/About page file only:

- Ensure there are **no** occurrences of:
  - "Signal / Value / Human"
  - "validate the signal"
  - "AI-powered platform", "revolutionary AI", "game-changing agents", "AI magic"
  - "StackMe", "Stackme Holdings", or "VSP" as active brand names
  - any generic “the human” phrasing; prefer “people”, “individuals”, “participants”, or “personhood/dignity”

- Make sure the page explicitly mentions:
  - “Truth, Capital, and Dignity”
  - “AI-native”
  - “run on our own balance sheet first”
  - “non-custodial by design”

Do not touch other pages or routes in this checkpoint.
