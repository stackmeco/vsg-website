Here is the **Master Implementation Prompt** to fix the UI verbiage and install the professional 2-minute script.

**FINAL CONTENT & AUDIO UPGRADE**

We need to professionalize the Audio Player and update the audio generation script with the final approved copy.

### 1. UPDATE UI VERBIAGE (`client/src/components/AudioModal.tsx`)
**Objective:** Remove sci-fi terms ("Transmission") and replace with business terms ("Briefing").

**Action:** Update the text labels inside the component:
* Change "Incoming Transmission" to **"EXECUTIVE BRIEFING"**.
* Change "CLOSE TRANSMISSION" to **"CLOSE BRIEFING"**.
* If there is a timestamp label (e.g., "02:04"), change the label next to it to **"DURATION"**.

### 2. UPDATE GENERATION SCRIPT (`server/scripts/generate_briefing.ts`)
**Objective:** We have the final 2-minute script. Overwrite the `SCRIPT` constant in the generator file with this exact SSML block:

```typescript
const SCRIPT = `

    This is an operational overview of Verifiable Systems Group.

    As AI agents begin to execute complex economic tasks, they face two failure modes.
    First, Settlement Failure. Traditional banking—with its reversible transactions and multi-day settlement—cannot support the millisecond-latency requirements of machine commerce.
    Second, Cognitive Failure. Probabilistic AI models are prone to hallucination, making them unfit for high-stakes financial decision-making.
    <break time="1s"/>
    VSG architectures the solution to these problems. We build deterministic systems where state, logic, and risk are verifiable.

    Our platform rests on three pillars.
    <break time="500ms"/>
    One: Digital Assets. We utilize Bitcoin not as a speculative instrument, but as a settlement rail. It provides the cryptographic finality required for software to hold and transfer value without counterparty risk.
    <break time="500ms"/>
    Two: Deterministic Intelligence. Our Axiom project is an inference layer that constrains Large Language Models. It forces AI to anchor outputs to verified internal records, ensuring auditability.
    <break time="500ms"/>
    Three: Physical Verification. Our Lumina project links on-chain assets to physical inventory using optical physics for anti-spoofing.
    <break time="1s"/>
    Our operational model is equally rigorous.
    VSG is a unified R&D unit capitalized by a proprietary Bitcoin treasury.
    We utilize conservative, over-collateralized borrowing to fund development.
    We do not manage third-party capital. We do not sell tokens. We do not offer yield products.
    We operate as a closed-loop laboratory: we do not deploy code that we are not willing to fund with our own balance sheet.

    If you are a capital partner or technical founder aligned with first-principles engineering, you can review our active development cycles in the Pipeline section.

### **Step 2: Generate the MP3 (Manual Step)**
After Replit applies the code above, you must run this command in the **Shell/Terminal** to actually create the new audio file:

```bash
npx tsx server/scripts/generate_briefing.ts
````

*(Note: This requires your Google Cloud credentials to be set in Replit Secrets. If you haven't set that up, the script will fail, and you'll need to upload the MP3 manually to `client/public/system_briefing.mp3`.)*
