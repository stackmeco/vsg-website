This is the **Definitive Master Specification (v8.0)**.

I have reviewed the entire project history and your specific feedback regarding "spacing issues" and "missing the mark."

**The Core Improvements:**
1.  **Layout Strategy:** I have restructured the **"How We Work" (Principles)** section. The previous "Small Card" grid was too cramped for your new, deeper copy. I have switched this to a **"2-Column Wide-Card Grid."** This allows the "Manifesto" style text to breathe without breaking the "Control Room" aesthetic.
2.  **Content Fidelity:** I have integrated your **exact "Version 2" copy** (Force Multiplier, Engineered Ambition) instead of my previous suggestions.
3.  **Component Mapping:** I explicitly map *which* text goes into *which* visual component so the AI developer doesn't guess.

## **2. PAGE: MISSION (`Overview.tsx`)**

### **SECTION A: HERO (The Hook)**
* **Layout:** Centered, Full-Width.
* **Label:** "Two-founder studio"
* **Headline:** "The Infrastructure of Autonomy."
* **Subhead:** "We are an innovation engine fusing the speed of AI with the security of Blockchain. We build the tools that verify truth, preserve wealth, and protect identity."
* **Primary Button:** "See Our Ventures"
* **Secondary Button:** "Audio Overview" *(Icon: Play)*

### **SECTION B: THE DIRECTIVE (Who We Are)**
* **Layout:** 3-Column Grid (Standard Cards).
* **Component:** `Card` with `CardContent`.

**Card 1: Purpose**
* **Headline:** "Democratize Leverage"
* **Body:** "To democratize institutional-grade leverage. We build tools that give individuals the same financial power as banks, without the intermediaries."

**Card 2: Vision**
* **Headline:** "Engineered Trust"
* **Body:** "A future where 'Trust' is an engineered feature, not a gamble. We replace blind faith with cryptographic proof and open code."

**Card 3: Mission**
* **Headline:** "Verifiable Autonomy"
* **Body:** "We engineer infrastructure across three pillars: \n• **Validate Signal** (Axiom)\n• **Preserve Value** (Helios)\n• **Protect Identity** (Uniqueness)"

### **SECTION C: OPERATING PRINCIPLES (How We Work)**
* **Layout:** **2-Column Grid** (`grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2`).
* **Spacing:** Increased padding (`p-8`) to accommodate longer text.
* **Typography:** `text-lg` for Headers, `text-base` (`leading-relaxed`) for Body.

**Card 1: Intelligence Augmented (IA)**
* **Icon:** `Zap`
* **Quote:** "Let the machine compute. Let the human connect."
* **Body:** "We use AI to amplify human capability. By offloading high-velocity data processing to our Helios engine, we free our team to focus on the things machines cannot do: strategy, empathy, and judgment."

**Card 2: Seek the Signal**
* **Icon:** `Eye`
* **Quote:** "Verify, then trust."
* **Body:** "We recognize that narratives are often engineered to obscure reality. We don't rely on blind faith or centralized perception; we engineer clarity through cryptographic proof."

**Card 3: Engineered Ambition**
* **Icon:** `Shield`
* **Quote:** "Dream in decades, execute in milliseconds."
* **Body:** "We are building generational technology—from automated capital engines to optical surface scanning—with extreme precision. We embrace big risks by managing them with rigorous, automated safety rails."

**Card 4: Own the Engine**
* **Icon:** `Cog`
* **Quote:** "Master the mechanics to rewrite the rules."
* **Body:** "We are a team of architects, not passengers. We require deep financial fluency and a first-principles understanding of how value is created, stored, and protected within our treasury."

**Card 5: Value is a Mirror**
* **Icon:** `Users`
* **Quote:** "Serve first, succeed second."
* **Body:** "We succeed only when our users thrive. We build non-custodial tools that restore power to the user—providing liquidity without selling assets—knowing that true value flows from service, not extraction."

**Card 6: Force Multiplier**
* **Icon:** `Scale`
* **Quote:** "Level the playing field."
* **Body:** "Structural asymmetries favor the incumbent. We build leverage for the underdog. We arm individuals with the tools to bypass gatekeepers and access the capabilities usually reserved for massive institutions."

## **3. PAGE: PROCESS (`System.tsx`)**

* **Headline:** "How We Work"
* **Body:** "We operate as a venture studio. By utilizing shared infrastructure across multiple specialized companies, we achieve high velocity without compromising security."

### **SECTION B: THE LEXICON (Definitions)**
* **Verifiable Systems:** "Software that anyone can audit. No black boxes. The logic is visible, the risk is defined, and the outcome is provable."
* **Cited AI:** "Artificial Intelligence that tells you where it got its information. It doesn't guess; it retrieves facts from verified documents."
* **Bearer Assets:** "Digital items you truly own. They can move freely across the internet without needing permission from a bank or platform."

### **SECTION C: THE TREASURY**
* **Headline:** "Powered by Bitcoin."
* **Body:** "Bitcoin serves as our reserve asset. Rather than liquidating capital to fund operations, we utilize responsible, over-collateralized borrowing. This sustains our long-term balance sheet while funding continuous innovation."

### **8. AI DEVELOPER INSTRUCTIONS**
*Paste this into the AI Agent to execute.*

> **TASK:** Update the website content to match `MASTER_SPEC_v8.md`.
>
> **CRITICAL LAYOUT CHANGE:**
> In `client/src/pages/Overview.tsx`, locate the "Operating Principles" section.
> * **Current:** `grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` (Small Cards).
> * **New:** `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2` (Wide Cards).
> * **Reason:** The new "Manifesto" text is longer. The cards need to be taller and wider to support the paragraph length without cramping.
>
> **STYLE OVERRIDES:**
> 1.  Force `rounded-sm` to `2px` in Tailwind config.
> 2.  Set Base Font to `16px`.
> 3.  Use `text-foreground` (White) for all Body text in Principles cards. Do not use Grey.
