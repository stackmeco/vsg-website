Project: Verifiable-Systems-Group (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, routing via wouter in client/src/App.tsx).

Goal for this checkpoint

Run a repo-wide polish pass on user-facing copy so everything is aligned with:
- VSG Brand & Voice System v3.0
- The Truth · Capital · Dignity model
- The Architect/Judge voice (precise, infrastructural, low-hype)
- AI-native, internal-first, non-custodial stance

Scope: Only update user-facing text in React components and data files under client/src. Do NOT change component structures, routing, types, or styles, unless needed to fix a typo caused by the edits.

Concretely: Work in
- client/src/**/*.tsx
- client/src/data/**/*.ts

Do NOT touch:
- config files
- package.json
- build tooling
- non-React code outside client/src

--------------------------------------------------
1) Remove legacy domain model (Signal / Value / Human)
--------------------------------------------------

Search across client/src for legacy domain headings and phrases related to the old three-pillar model.

1.1 Domain headings

Look for headings or labels that use the old model as proper nouns, such as:

- "Signal", "Value", "Human" when used as section / card titles in a list.
- Example patterns:
  - `<h2>Signal</h2>`
  - `<h3>Signal – …</h3>`
  - lists like "Signal · Value · Human"

For any of these, update them to:

- "Truth"
- "Capital"
- "Dignity"

Use the new triad as appropriate to context:

- Truth → anything that deals with evidence, provenance, inspection, grading, verification (e.g. Lumina).
- Capital → anything related to treasuries, flows, risk limits, leverage (e.g. Helios).
- Dignity → anything related to people, participation, personhood, access, or uniqueness (e.g. Uniqueness Engine).

Do NOT change occurrences of “signal”, “value”, or “human” that are clearly generic lowercase words in sentences. Only fix headings, labels, and obvious domain references.

1.2 Phrases like "Validate the signal"

Search for the exact phrase:

- "validate the signal"
- "Validate the signal"

Replace with more precise language that maps to Truth without sounding like an old domain name. For example:

- "anchor claims in verifiable evidence"
- "make the underlying facts inspectable"

Choose whichever variant fits best per context, but keep the meaning: evidence over vibes.

--------------------------------------------------
2) Remove creepy / off-brand "the human" usages
--------------------------------------------------

Search for:

- "the human" (case insensitive)

For each occurrence:

- If used to mean “people in general”, rewrite to “people” or “participants”.
- If used in a domain-like sense (e.g., "Signal, Value, the human"), convert to the new triad or remove entirely, as appropriate.

Example rewrites:

- "protect the human" → "protect people" or "protect their dignity" (depending on context).
- "the human in the loop" → "people in the loop" or "human judgment in the loop".

Ensure the new phrasing stays aligned with the Truth / Capital / Dignity framing and the Architect/Judge tone.

--------------------------------------------------
3) Strip generic AI hype and fix AI language
--------------------------------------------------

Search for the following phrases in user-facing text:

- "AI-powered"
- "AI powered"
- "revolutionary"
- "disruptive"
- "game-changing"
- "AI magic"
- "AI does the rest"
- "move fast and break things"
- "hypergrowth"

For each, rewrite to fit VSG’s AI-native stance:

- Use phrases like:
  - "AI-native"
  - "machine intelligence in the loop"
  - "AI handles the mechanics; people own the mandate"
  - "we use machine intelligence to surface risk and enforce constraints"

Rules:
- Emphasize AI as **infrastructure**, not spectacle.
- Emphasize constraints, governance, and human veto.
- Never suggest AI is magic or fully autonomous.

Example transformation:

- "An AI-powered platform that revolutionizes grading" →  
  "AI-native infrastructure for grading that uses machine intelligence to standardize captures and surface anomalies under clear constraints."

Make sure replacements read naturally in context and keep sentences lean.

--------------------------------------------------
4) Remove legacy brand names and confusion (StackMe / VSP)
--------------------------------------------------

Search for these strings:

- "StackMe"
- "Stackme"
- "Stackme app"
- "Stackme Holdings"
- "Stackme Holding"
- "VSP "
- "VSP-"
- "VSP "

For any user-facing text referencing old brand names in the current public site:

- Replace with "Verifiable Systems Group" or "VSG" if you need a shorter label.
- If the reference is historical or no longer relevant (e.g. "StackMe Holdings LLC was previously…"), remove or tighten it so the current public site doesn’t talk about outdated internal names.

Exceptions:
- If a page is clearly a legal or archival note that must mention a previous name, keep it but ensure it’s framed as historical and not current (e.g., “formerly operated under the name…”). However, avoid putting this in user-facing marketing copy.

--------------------------------------------------
5) Unify Truth · Capital · Dignity references
--------------------------------------------------

Search for any remaining list-like references to the three domains in public copy.

- Convert any old references (Signal/Value/Human) into the new triad:
  - Truth · Capital · Dignity

Ensure consistency:

- Capitalize the three terms when used as the abstract domains:
  - "Truth, Capital, and Dignity"
- Use them sparingly and only where the triad is explicitly being introduced or referenced.

Where relevant (e.g., Overview, Ventures index, Approach pages), make sure the triad is described clearly in one short paragraph:

- Truth → evidence / what can be trusted
- Capital → how value moves
- Dignity → how people participate without overexposure

If you find multiple slightly different explanations, converge them into one consistent phrasing across the site, adjusted only as needed by context.

--------------------------------------------------
6) Tighten hero and section intros (length + tone)
--------------------------------------------------

For the main hero sections on:

- Overview / Studio page
- Ventures index page
- Helios page
- Lumina page
- Uniqueness Engine page
- Approach page
- Process page

Do the following:

1) Keep each hero body paragraph in the range of ~40–80 words.
2) Ensure tone is:
   - Calm, precise, architectural.
   - No exclamation marks in heroes.
   - At most one “you shouldn’t have to…” or similar warm line per hero.
3) Make sure each hero:
   - States plainly what the page is about in the first sentence.
   - Includes own-balance-sheet-first or internal-first positioning where relevant.
   - Avoids hype adjectives and vague promises.

If a hero body feels too long or repetitive, cut filler rather than adding more qualifiers.

--------------------------------------------------
7) Light pass on outer-ring pages (Connect / Terms / Privacy / 404)
--------------------------------------------------

Within client/src:

- Find the Connect or Contact page, any 404 page, and any Terms/Privacy pages that render user-facing text.

For these:

- Ensure there are no references to old names (StackMe, VSP, etc.).
- Ensure there is no language that accidentally sounds like:
  - An investment offer
  - Yield / return promises
  - Legal, tax, or regulatory advice

For Connect/Contact:

- Keep tone precise and reserved but not cold. Example pattern:
  - "Tell us what you’re trying to verify, protect, or build. We take on a limited number of external conversations and prioritize work where verifiable autonomy matters."

For Terms/Privacy:

- Don’t try to rewrite the entire legal structure; just:
  - Fix any obviously outdated brand names.
  - Remove any hype-y or marketing language.
  - Ensure any disclaimers are clear that nothing on the site is investment, legal, or tax advice.

--------------------------------------------------
8) General hygiene rules for this pass
--------------------------------------------------

While editing, follow these rules:

- User-facing copy only:
  - Do not rename components, variables, or TypeScript types unless absolutely necessary to fix a typo.
- No new sections:
  - Don’t add or remove major sections or components, just refine strings.
- Keep brand canon intact:
  - Do not change the canonical Purpose / Vision / Mission wording.
  - Do not change the core one-line description of VSG if already aligned to v3.
- No emojis, no memes, no slang.
- Prefer second-person address ("you") only where there is a clear Warm On-Ramp moment; otherwise, keep things declarative and neutral.

--------------------------------------------------
9) Final checks
--------------------------------------------------

After the edits:

1) Ensure the code still compiles:
   - Run the dev server and confirm the app builds without TypeScript or JSX errors.

2) Spot-check the following pages in the browser:
   - /
   - /ventures
   - /ventures/helios
   - /ventures/lumina
   - /ventures/uniqueness
   - /approach
   - /process
   - /standards
   - /insights
   - /connect (or equivalent)
   - terms/privacy routes if present

3) Confirm:
   - No old triad (Signal/Value/Human) visible as domain names.
   - No legacy brand names in public-facing copy.
   - No AI hype phrases.
   - All heroes feel consistent in tone and length with the v3 voice.

Only commit these copy changes once the app builds cleanly and the above pages pass visual and content inspection.
