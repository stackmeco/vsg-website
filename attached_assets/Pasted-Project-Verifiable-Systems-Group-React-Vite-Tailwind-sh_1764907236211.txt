Project: Verifiable-Systems-Group (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, routing via wouter in client/src/App.tsx).

Goal for this checkpoint

Do a final **polish pass on the Connect/Contact experience and the 404 page** so they:

- Match VSG Brand & Voice System v3.0
- Reflect the Truth · Capital · Dignity framing implicitly (without over-explaining)
- Use the Architect/Judge voice (precise, calm, non-salesy)
- Are clear about what kinds of conversations we actually want
- Avoid any language that could be misread as investment, legal, or tax advice

Do NOT change:

- Form fields, validation, or submission logic
- Page routing or layout primitives
- Legal disclaimers or privacy/terms structures

Only update user-facing text (headings, paragraphs, helper text, button labels) in the **Connect/Contact page** and the **404/not-found page**.

--------------------------------------------------
1) Locate Connect / Contact and 404 pages
--------------------------------------------------

1.1 Connect / Contact page

Find the component that renders the “contact us” / “connect” route, e.g.:

- client/src/pages/Connect.tsx
- client/src/pages/Contact.tsx
- or whichever component is mapped to "/connect" (or similar) in client/src/App.tsx.

This is the “outer ring” page where users can reach out.

1.2 404 / NotFound page

Find the component used for “not found” routes, e.g.:

- client/src/pages/NotFound.tsx
- client/src/pages/404.tsx

or whatever component is rendered as a catch-all in App.tsx.

All changes below apply only to those two pages.

--------------------------------------------------
2) Connect page – hero and framing
--------------------------------------------------

On the Connect page:

2.1 PageMeta

If this page uses <PageMeta> (or equivalent), set:

- title:
    "Connect"
- description:
    "Connect with Verifiable Systems Group about verifiable autonomy—where truth, capital, and dignity are at stake. We prioritize conversations where infrastructure, not slogans, is the problem."

Keep preloadImage or other props unchanged.

2.2 Hero overline

Set the small overline (if present) to:

  "Connect · Verifiable Systems Group"

2.3 Hero heading

Set the main <h1> to:

  "Talk to us when verification matters."

2.4 Hero body (1–2 short paragraphs)

Replace the hero body copy with:

First paragraph (~30–45 words):

  "We’re a studio for verifiable autonomy, not a high-volume agency. We take on a limited number of conversations where the core problem is structural: how truth is proven, how capital moves, or how people participate without overexposure."

Second paragraph (~20–30 words):

  "If you’re facing those questions in a serious way, we’re interested. If you just need generic AI or marketing, we’re probably not the right fit."

Keep layout and classes the same; just update the text.

2.5 Call-to-action text around the form

If there is a short sentence above the form, update it to something like:

  "Tell us what you’re trying to verify, protect, or build. Be as specific as you can—what’s at stake if this system is wrong, brittle, or opaque?"

If there are separate helper labels near form fields (e.g., “Project description”), you can add small helper text where it fits:

- For a “Topic” or “Reason” field:
  - Helper:
    "Examples: grading infrastructure, treasury rails, personhood in a network."

- For a “Message” or “Details” field:
  - Helper:
    "What’s the system? Who does it serve? What goes wrong if it fails silently?"

Do not change field names or their types—only optional helper text.

2.6 Submit button text

If the submit button label is something generic like “Submit” or “Send”, update it to:

  "Send message"

Do not add extra text or icons; keep it simple.

--------------------------------------------------
3) Connect page – expectations and disclaimers
--------------------------------------------------

Below the form (or in a small sidebar/footnote), add or refine a short expectations block. Use existing typography components (e.g., <p>, <small>).

Suggested block:

Heading (if the layout uses one for small sections):
  "What to expect"

Body (2–3 short lines):

  "We review incoming messages for clear alignment with our work on Truth, Capital, or Dignity. We can’t respond to every inquiry or provide individual investment, legal, or tax advice."

Add a muted note (small text):

  "Nothing on this site or in our replies should be treated as financial, legal, or tax advice."

Do NOT alter any existing formal legal notices—this is just user-facing expectation setting.

--------------------------------------------------
4) 404 / NotFound page – voice and guidance
--------------------------------------------------

On the 404 / NotFound component:

4.1 Heading

Set the main heading to:

  "This page isn’t wired up."

4.2 Body copy

Replace the body paragraph(s) with two short lines:

First line (~15–25 words):

  "Either this page never existed or it hasn’t been wired into the current site. In either case, there’s nothing verifiable here yet."

Second line (~15–25 words):

  "Use the links below to get back to the parts of the system that are live and inspectable."

Tone: calm, a bit architectural, not jokey. No exclamation points.

4.3 Navigation back to main areas

If the 404 already has a “Back home” link, keep it and refine text. If not, add a small list of links using existing button/link components.

Buttons or links (use whichever pattern is already present):

- Label:
    "Go to overview"
  href:
    "/"

- Label:
    "Explore ventures"
  href:
    "/ventures"

- Label:
    "See how we build"
  href:
    "/approach"

Do not change the layout or styling—just ensure the labels and hrefs are as above.

--------------------------------------------------
5) Hygiene & brand checks on these pages
--------------------------------------------------

In the Connect and 404 components:

1) Ensure there are **no**:
   - References to "Signal, Value, Human" as domains.
   - Phrases like "AI-powered platform", "revolutionary", "game-changing".
   - Old brands: "StackMe", "Stackme Holdings", "Stackme app", "VSP".
   - Uses of "the human" as a noun; prefer “people” or “participants”.

2) Ensure:
   - Connect page clearly sets expectations:
     - Limited number of conversations.
     - Focused on structural/verification problems.
     - No implication of investment/legal/tax advice.
   - 404 page:
     - Stays calm and functional.
     - Points back to valid routes clearly.
     - Matches the overall visual style and tone.

3) Keep warmth controlled:
   - Connect page: a bit more human than the rest (direct “you” language is fine).
   - 404 page: minimal warmth, mainly structural guidance.

--------------------------------------------------
6) Final checks
--------------------------------------------------

After making these edits:

1) Ensure both files compile:
   - No TypeScript or JSX errors.

2) Run the dev server and verify:
   - "/connect" (or equivalent) renders with the new hero copy, helper text, and expectations block.
   - The form fields and logic still behave exactly as before.
   - The 404 page shows the new heading, copy, and navigation links.

3) Confirm:
   - No off-brand language slipped in on these pages.
   - The tone matches the rest of the polished site.

Only commit once Connect and 404 feel consistent with the Overview, Ventures, Helios, Lumina, Uniqueness Engine, Approach, Process, and Standards pages.
