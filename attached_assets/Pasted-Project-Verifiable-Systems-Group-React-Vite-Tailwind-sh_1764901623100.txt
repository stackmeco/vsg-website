Project: Verifiable-Systems-Group (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, routing via wouter in client/src/App.tsx).

Goal for this checkpoint

Align the Studio data model with the latest VSG Identity & Brand & Voice v3.0, without changing layout or visual design. Only update the text content inside client/src/data/studio.ts so that:
- The Purpose / Vision / Mission TL;DRs match the new canon.
- The execution principles refer to a Six-Stage Process, not a Five-Stage Process.

Do not touch any other files.

---

File to edit

- client/src/data/studio.ts

---

1) Update Purpose / Vision / Mission TL;DRs (pvm)

In the `export const pvm = [...]` array, make these changes:

- Keep the `id`, `label`, and `href` fields exactly as they are.
- Update only the `tldr` values to:

  - Purpose:
    - `tldr: "Democratize institutional-grade leverage.",`
      (this may already match; if so, leave it as-is)

  - Vision:
    - `tldr: "A future where trust is an engineered feature, not a gamble.",`

  - Mission:
    - `tldr: "We engineer the infrastructure of verifiable autonomy.",`

Make sure the punctuation and capitalization are exactly as above.

---

2) Update the “Five-Stage Process” execution principle → “Six-Stage Process”

In the `export const executionPrinciples = [...]` array in the same file, find the entry with:

- `id: "five-stage"`
- `name: "Five-Stage Process"`

Change it to:

- `id: "six-stage"`
- `name: "Six-Stage Process"`
- `description:` set to the following string (replacing the old description completely):

  `"Every venture moves through a six-stage runway—Define, Validate, Build, Deploy, Evolve, Learn—with clear gates between each stage so risk is surfaced early, learning compounds, and nothing advances by default."`

Do not change the order of the array or any other executionPrinciples entries.

---

3) Clean-up in this file only

- After these edits, make sure the string `"Five-Stage Process"` does not appear anywhere in client/src/data/studio.ts.
- Do NOT modify:
  - `export const pillars`, `export const values`, `export const pillarsInPractice`, `export const purposeRulesOut`, or `export const visionSuccess` beyond the two changes described above.
  - Any TypeScript types at the bottom of the file.

---

4) Quality checks

- Ensure the file still compiles with `pnpm dev` or `npm run dev` (no TypeScript errors).
- The imports/exports from studio.ts must remain exactly as they are.

Only commit these changes once the app builds cleanly.
