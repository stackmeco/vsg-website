You are editing the codebase for **Verifiable Systems Group (VSG)**.

VSG is an **AI-native, cryptography-grounded venture studio** that builds **verifiable systems for capital, identity, and intelligence**, and runs every serious pattern on its **own balance sheet first**.

Brand canon (non-negotiable):
- Our three domains are **Truth**, **Capital**, and **Dignity** — these replace any older “Signal / Value / Human” framing.
  - Truth — Make decisions rest on evidence, not stories.
  - Capital — Make capital work without leaving governed, non-custodial control.
  - Dignity — Protect people and their personhood; prove eligibility and uniqueness without surveillance.
- We are **AI-native**: machine intelligence is part of the mechanism and governance loops, not a bolt-on.
- We are **non-custodial by design** and **balance-sheet-first**.
- Tone: serious, architectural, ethically explicit; no hype, no memes, no “AI-powered platform” language.
- Forbidden phrases (rewrite any you find): 
  - “validate the signal”
  - “Signal / Value / Human” as pillars
  - “the human”
  - “AI-powered platform”
  - “revolutionary AI”, “game-changing agents”, “AI magic”
  - casual slang or meme language

Before changing copy or labels, align them with:
- `docs/brand/VSG-Brand-Voice-System-v3.0.md`
- `docs/brand/VSG-Identity.md`

Now perform a controlled global user-facing text cleanup:

Project: Verifiable-Systems-Group (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, routing via wouter in client/src/App.tsx).

Goal:
Align user-facing text across the app with Brand & Voice System v3.0 and remove old/banned language.

Scope:
- Only user-facing strings in React components, page files, and shared meta config.
- Do NOT rename components, variables, routes, or change logic.

Tasks:

1) Global title pattern + default meta
- Ensure the main HTML `<title>` pattern is: `<Page Title> — Verifiable Systems Group`.
- Set or update the shared default meta description (used by `<PageMeta>` or equivalent) to:

  “Verifiable Systems Group is an AI-native, cryptography-grounded venture studio. We build verifiable systems for capital, identity, and intelligence, running every serious pattern on our own balance sheet first across Truth, Capital, and Dignity.”

2) Navigation naming
- In the main layout/nav component, align primary nav items to:

  - Overview → `/`
  - Ventures → `/ventures`
  - Approach → `/approach` (or whatever route currently represents the Process/Approach page)
  - Governance → `/governance` or `/standards` (use existing route, just update label)
  - Insights → `/insights`

- Under the “Ventures” dropdown, ensure labels clearly show the domain in the subtitle or secondary text, for example:
  - “Helios — Capital”
  - “Lumina — Truth”
  - “Uniqueness Engine — Dignity”
  - Any VSP/Axiom rails page — “Truth”

3) Phrase remapping (user-facing text only)
Search user-facing copy and rewrite surrounding sentences to align with v3.0 when you find:

- “validate the signal”  
  → Replace with language about making decisions rest on **evidence, not stories** (e.g., “We make decisions rest on evidence, not stories, by anchoring outputs to provenance and tamper-evident logs.”)

- “Signal / Value / Human” (or “Signal, Value, Human”) as pillars  
  → Replace with **Truth, Capital, Dignity** as domains.

- “protect the human”  
  → Replace with “protect people and their personhood” or “protect people and their dignity”.

- “AI-powered platform”, “revolutionary AI”, “game-changing agents”, “AI magic”  
  → Replace with phrases like “AI-native infrastructure”, “machine intelligence in the loop”, “structural”, “infrastructure-grade”, “move fast inside guardrails”, or “verifiable”.

- “the human” when used in a generic, dehumanizing way  
  → Replace with “people”, “individuals”, “you”, “personhood”, or “dignity” depending on context.

4) Safety
- Do NOT introduce protocol names, specific venues, LTV numbers, wallet topologies, or bank names into public pages.
- Keep public copy principle-level, non-custodial, conservative, and aligned with the brand docs.

After changes, make sure the app still builds and runs with no TypeScript or runtime errors.
