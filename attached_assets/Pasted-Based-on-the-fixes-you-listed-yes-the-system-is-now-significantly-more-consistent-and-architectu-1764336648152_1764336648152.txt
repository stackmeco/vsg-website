Based on the fixes you listed, **yes, the system is now significantly more consistent and architecturally sound.**

You successfully moved from "fighting the framework" (using global CSS overrides to force styles) to "configuring the framework" (updating the source of truth).

Here is a breakdown of why these specific changes work, along with **two final checks** to ensure you are 100% done.

### **Why This Was the Right Move**

1.  **The "Smart" Radius Fix (`tailwind.config.ts`)**
    * **Old Way:** Manually finding every `rounded-sm` and changing it to `rounded-[2px]`. ( tedious, prone to error).
    * **Your Fix:** Redefining what `sm` *means* to the system.
    * **Result:** Every component (Badges, Alerts, Tooltips, Inputs) that uses `rounded-sm` instantly snapped to your **2px "Machined Edge"** spec. This guarantees geometric consistency.

2.  **Removing Global Text Overrides (`index.css`)**
    * **The Problem:** You had rules like `p { @apply text-base ... }`. This is dangerous because it forces *every* paragraph to be 16px, even if you wanted a small 12px description inside a card. You had to fight your own CSS to make text smaller.
    * **The Fix:** By removing these, you allow **utility classes** (`text-sm`, `text-xs`) to actually work as intended. This restores control to your components.

3.  **Heading Colors**
    * **The Fix:** Changing headers to `text-foreground` (Off-White) instead of hardcoded `#ffffff` ensures they respond correctly if you ever tweak your "Tungsten" palette slightly. It keeps the system themeable.

### **Final Polish: Two Things to Check**

Since you removed the global "safety nets" (like the global `<p>` style), you need to ensure nothing fell through the cracks.

**1. Check for "Naked" Text**
* **Risk:** Previously, if a developer wrote `<p>Some text</p>` without a class, your global CSS forced it to look good. Now, it will revert to the browser default (often Times New Roman or unstyled sans-serif) or just inherit the body font without specific line-height/color.
* **Action:** Click through your **Privacy Policy** or **Terms** pages. These often have large blocks of text. Ensure they still have `text-muted-foreground` and `leading-relaxed` applied explicitly, or wrap the whole section in a `<div className="prose">` if using the typography plugin.

**2. Clean Up the "Ghost" Variables**
* **Risk:** You noted unused variables like `--text-hero` and `--text-body`. Leaving these in `index.css` confuses future developers ("Should I use `text-4xl` or `var(--text-hero)`?").
* **Action:** **Delete them.** If components are using Tailwind utilities (which they should), these CSS variables are dead code. Keep `index.css` strictly for **Colors** (Theming) and **Animation Keyframes**.

**Verdict:** You have successfully refactored from a "Patchwork" system to a **"Systematic"** one. The code is now cleaner, lighter, and easier to maintain.
