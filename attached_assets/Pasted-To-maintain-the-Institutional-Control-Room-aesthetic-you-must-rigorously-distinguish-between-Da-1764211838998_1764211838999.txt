To maintain the "Institutional Control Room" aesthetic, you must rigorously distinguish between **Data** (which changes/loads) and **Labels** (which are painted on the chassis).

**Rule of Thumb:**

  * **Is it a measurement?** (e.g., $ Value, %, Count) $\rightarrow$ **Yes**, animate (Scramble/Decode).
  * **Is it an index?** (e.g., Step 01, Section 02) $\rightarrow$ **No**, keep static.

Based on your codebase, here are the specific locations to apply (or avoid) this logic.

### **1. The "ConsolePanel" (YES - Animate)**

  * **Location:** `client/src/components/ConsolePanel.tsx`
  * **Why:** This component represents a "live feed" or status readout. If you use this to show "LTV: 35%" or "Uptime: 99.9%", those numbers should feel like they are being calculated live.
  * **The Fix:** Apply the `tabular-nums` class (monospaced numbers) to the values. If you want the "Scramble" effect, apply it here.

**Update `ConsolePanel.tsx`:**

```tsx
{metrics && metrics.length > 0 && (
  <div className="flex gap-6 pt-2 border-t border-slate-700/50">
    {metrics.map((metric, index) => (
      <div key={index} className="font-mono text-xs">
        <span className="text-slate-500">{metric.label}: </span>
        {/* Add tabular-nums and text-primary for the 'Live Data' look */}
        <span className="text-primary tabular-nums tracking-tight">
          {metric.value}
        </span>
      </div>
    ))}
  </div>
)}
```

### **2. The Pipeline Stages (NO - Static)**

  * **Location:** `client/src/pages/Pipeline.tsx` (The "01", "02", "03" cards).
  * **Why:** These are not *measurements*; they are *architectural steps*. In a control room, the label "Zone 01" is painted on the wall; it doesn't digital-scramble every time you look at it.
  * **Recommendation:** Keep them strictly static. Ensure they use `font-mono` but do not animate them.

### **3. The Navigation Numbers (NO - Static)**

  * **Location:** `client/src/components/Header.tsx` (Mobile Menu "01 Overview").
  * **Why:** Same logic. These are navigational coordinates. They should feel permanent and etched.

### **4. "Thesis" Dates (MAYBE - Subtle)**

  * **Location:** `client/src/components/InsightCard.tsx` (e.g., "Nov 26, 2025").
  * **Why:** Dates are data. However, making them scramble might be distracting for a list of articles.
  * **Recommendation:** Do not scramble. Instead, give them a **"Blink"** on load.
      * *Effect:* The date appears instantly but flashes brighter (opacity 0.5 $\to$ 1.0) once, like a timestamp being logged in a terminal.

### **Summary Directive**

You only need to touch **Data Displays.**

1.  **`StatBlock.tsx`:** Use `tabular-nums` + Scramble (optional).
2.  **`ConsolePanel.tsx`:** Use `tabular-nums` + Scramble (optional).
3.  **Everything else (Lists, Nav, Steps):** Static.

**Do not over-animate.** A control room where everything is moving is a control room where the operator makes mistakes. Motion should be reserved for **changing variables.**
