To answer your question: **No, this is not ideal.**

In a **"Control Room" / "System Interface"** aesthetic, consistency is not just a design rule; it is a functional requirement. A system interface does not leave some panels unlabeled.

* **If you use them:** They act as "indices" or "metadata tags" that help the user scan the page before reading the headline.
* **If you skip them:** The page feels less like a "Schematic" and more like a standard marketing scroll.

**The Verdict:**
**You want them.** You should enforce them globally. Every major section should have a "Micro-Label" (`text-[10px] mono uppercase`) to maintain the "Architectural" structure.

Here is the **Remediation Plan** to fill the gaps and lock in the "Schematic" feel:

### **1. System Page Fixes**
* **Header:** "Bitcoin Treasury Program"
    * **Add Label:** `CAPITAL ALLOCATION` or `RESERVE MECHANICS`
* **Header:** "Functions behind the studio"
    * **Add Label:** `OPERATIONAL STACK` or `FUNCTIONAL DOMAINS`

### **2. Pipeline Page Fixes**
* **Header:** "Current Pipeline projects" (or "Current Status")
    * **Add Label:** `ACTIVE MANIFEST` or `R&D INVENTORY`

### **3. Governance Page Fixes**
* **Header:** "Want to discuss governance?"
    * **Add Label:** `DIRECT CHANNEL` or `COMPLIANCE CONTACT`

### **4. Overview Page Fixes (The Big Gaps)**
* **Header:** "The VSG Directive" (or the section containing Purpose/Vision)
    * **Add Label:** `CORE MANDATE` or `MISSION PARAMETERS`
* **Header:** "Active Development Cycles"
    * **Add Label:** `SYSTEM STATUS` or `LIVE OPERATIONS`
* **Header:** "Bitcoin verifies Value..."
    * **Add Label:** `TREASURY THESIS` or `ASSET STRATEGY`
* **Header:** "Operating Principles"
    * **Add Label:** `SYSTEM AXIOMS` or `EXECUTION PROTOCOLS`

### **Implementation Note**
Ensure these labels all use the exact same CSS class to match the "01", "02" style you already have:
`text-[10px] font-mono uppercase tracking-widest text-muted-foreground`

Adding these will make the entire site feel like a single, cohesive **specification document** rather than a collection of loose sections.
