You are updating the Studio section of this Verifiable Systems Group (VSG) site.

Goal: Implement the **Studio** overview page and the deep **Purpose / Vision / Mission** pages with REAL content from our brand identity. Keep everything visually consistent with the existing design system and make the copy highly scannable on web and mobile.

Important:
- The global nav and routes from Checkpoint 1 are already set up. DO NOT change the nav structure or routes.
- Use the existing layout / header / footer / typography. DO NOT introduce a new visual style.

### 1. Content & UX rules (very important)

Follow modern web UX and writing best practices:
- Short paragraphs (ideally 2–3 lines on mobile).
- Clear headings and subheadings.
- Bulleted lists where appropriate for scanning.
- No long, unbroken text blocks. 
- Use progressive disclosure: the overview page is lighter; the deep pages hold more detail. 

### 2. Implement `/studio` (Studio overview page)

Route: `/studio`

Structure:

- Hero section:
  - H1: “The infrastructure of autonomy.”
  - Subhead: 1–2 sentences explaining VSG as an AI-native, non-custodial finance R&D studio.

- Section: “Who we are”
  - Short paragraph explaining what VSG is and what we focus on.

- Section: “Three pillars”
  - Three mini-blocks for:
    - Validate Signal
    - Preserve Value
    - Protect Identity
  - Each: name + 1–2 sentence description + link to `/approach/pillars`.

- Section: “Purpose, Vision, Mission”
  - Three mini-blocks:
    - Purpose – TL;DR line + link to `/studio/purpose`
    - Vision – TL;DR line + link to `/studio/vision`
    - Mission – TL;DR line + link to `/studio/mission`

- Section: “Our values”
  - Grid of 4–6 tiles:
    - Intelligence-Augmented, Human-Accountable
    - Seek the Signal
    - Engineered Ambition
    - Own the Engine
    - Value is a Mirror
    - Force Multiplier
  - Each tile: value name + 1–2 sentence description.

Use existing card/section components for these tiles so the page matches the site’s overall look.

### 3. Implement `/studio/purpose`

Route: `/studio/purpose`

Structure:

- H1: “Our Purpose”
- TL;DR line at the top (one sentence).
- Section 1: “Why this exists”
  - 1–2 short paragraphs.
- Section 2: “What this purpose rules out”
  - Bulleted list of things we explicitly don’t do.
- Section 3: “How it guides decisions”
  - A few “When in doubt…” heuristics as bullets.

### 4. Implement `/studio/vision`

Route: `/studio/vision`

Structure:

- H1: “Our Vision”
- TL;DR line at the top.
- Section 1: “What’s broken today”
- Section 2: “The future we’re building toward”
- Section 3: “What success looks like”
  - Each section: 1–2 short paragraphs, max.

### 5. Implement `/studio/mission`

Route: `/studio/mission`

Structure:

- H1: “Our Mission”
- TL;DR line at the top.
- Section 1: “What we do now”
- Section 2: “Three pillars in practice”
- Section 3: “How we execute”
  - Explain AI-native, non-custodial rails, six-stage process, internal capital first, etc.

### 6. Implementation details

- Keep headings and spacing consistent with existing pages.
- Reuse shared layout components (e.g. main layout, section wrappers).
- DO NOT modify the nav or footer.
- DO NOT create new color schemes or typography tokens; use what already exists.

### 7. Content to use

In my NEXT MESSAGE I will paste the exact copy for:
- `/studio` sections
- `/studio/purpose`
- `/studio/vision`
- `/studio/mission`

Set up the page structures first, then use the copy I provide verbatim (minor formatting/JSX adjustments only).
