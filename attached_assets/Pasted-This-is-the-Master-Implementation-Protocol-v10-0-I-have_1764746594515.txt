This is the **Master Implementation Protocol (v10.0)**.

I have integrated the **6th Step ("Recursive Learning")** into the R&D Process to complete the grid and address the "learning from failure" requirement. I have also re-verified all content to ensure "Engineered Ambition" is used correctly and the tone remains "Institutional Vanguard."

**Major Improvements in v10.0:**
1.  **New Process Step:** Added **"Recursive Learning"** to `Ventures.tsx`. This closes the loop on failure analysis and creates a perfect 2x3 grid layout.
2.  **Tone Calibration:** Tightened the "Data-Driven Evolution" step to focus on *optimization* so it doesn't overlap with the new *learning* step.
3.  **Final Polish:** Verified that "Disciplined Audacity" is gone forever, replaced by **"Engineered Ambition"** (Mission) and **"Safety & Standards"** (Governance).

**How to use:**

>
> ### **PHASE 2: CONTENT INJECTION (The Identity Source of Truth)**
> *Overwrite text exactly as written below.*
>
> **1. MISSION PAGE (`Overview.tsx`):**
> * **Hero:** Headline **"The Infrastructure of Autonomy."** / Body **"We are an innovation engine fusing the speed of AI with the security of Blockchain. We build the tools that verify truth, preserve wealth, and protect identity."**
> * **Mission Cards:**
>     * *Purpose:* **"Democratize Leverage"** - "To democratize institutional-grade leverage. We build tools that give individuals the same financial power as banks, without the intermediaries."
>     * *Vision:* **"Engineered Trust"** - "A future where 'Trust' is an engineered feature, not a gamble. We replace blind faith with cryptographic proof and open code."
>     * *Mission:* **"Verifiable Autonomy"** - "We engineer the infrastructure of autonomy across three pillars: Validate Signal (Axiom), Preserve Value (Helios), and Protect Identity (Uniqueness)."
> * **Operating Principles:** Update `values` array:
>     1.  **Intelligence Augmented (IA):** "'Let the machine compute. Let the human connect.' We use AI to amplify human capability."
>     2.  **Seek the Signal:** "'Verify, then trust.' We engineer clarity through cryptographic proof."
>     3.  **Engineered Ambition:** "'Dream in decades, execute in milliseconds.' We build generational technology with extreme precision."
>     4.  **Own the Engine:** "'Master the mechanics to rewrite the rules.' We are pilots, not passengers."
>     5.  **Value is a Mirror:** "'Serve first, succeed second.' We build non-custodial tools that restore power to the user."
>     6.  **Force Multiplier:** "'Level the playing field.' We arm individuals with the tools to bypass gatekeepers."
>
> **2. PROCESS PAGE (`Process.tsx`):**
> * **Hero:** Headline **"Own The Engine."** / Body **"We are pilots, not passengers. We require deep financial fluency and a first-principles understanding of how value is created."**
> * **MOVE SECTION:** Move the **"How we verify value" (The R&D Process)** section from the old Pipeline page to HERE.
> * **REMOVE:** Delete the old "Functions" section.
> * **Treasury:** Headline **"Powered by Bitcoin."** / Body **"Bitcoin serves as our reserve asset. We utilize responsible, over-collateralized borrowing to fund innovation without selling our long-term position."**
>
> **3. VENTURES PAGE (`Ventures.tsx`):**
> * **Hero:** Headline **"Venture Portfolio."** / Body **"Five projects moving through our development process. Each venture is self-funded and stress-tested with our own capital."**
> * **Content:** Remove the "R&D Process" section (moved to Process). Show ONLY the Project Cards.
>
> **4. STANDARDS PAGE (`Standards.tsx`):**
> * **Hero:** Headline **"Safety & Standards."** / Body **"Technology moves fast. Ethics shouldn't. We impose strict rules on ourselves to ensure we build responsible systems."**
> * **Capital Controls:** Update to: "**2-of-3 Multisig** (Founder A, Founder B, Cold Storage). No single point of failure."
>
> **5. INSIGHTS PAGE (`Insights.tsx` & `data/articles.ts`):**
> * **Article 1:** "The Insolvency of Fiction: Why Financial AI Cannot Hallucinate"
> * **Article 2:** "The Verification Standard: Charting the Great Reallocation"

>
> ---
>
> ### **PHASE 3: THE R&D PROCESS (6 Steps)**
> *Update the `stages` array in `Process.tsx`. Use `grid md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` for a perfect 2x3 grid.*
>
> 1.  **Strategic Definition** (Alignment & ROI) - "We start with the problem, not the code. We verify the 'Why' before writing a single line."
> 2.  **Rapid Validation** (Risk Mitigation) - "We prove the concept early. Risk is best managed before the build using rapid prototyping."
> 3.  **The Verified Build** (Security & Stability) - "Engineering with automated safeguards. We build in iterative cycles with continuous verification."
> 4.  **Controlled Deployment** (Reliability) - "Zero-downtime staged rollouts. No 'big bang' releases. Features deploy incrementally."
> 5.  **Data-Driven Evolution** (Optimization) - "Launch is just the start. We aggressively monitor performance to refine efficiency based on real usage data."
> 6.  **Recursive Learning** (Institutional Wisdom) - "We treat failure as high-value signal. Every anomaly triggers a mandatory post-mortem. We feed these lessons back into the system root, ensuring we never make the same mistake twice."
