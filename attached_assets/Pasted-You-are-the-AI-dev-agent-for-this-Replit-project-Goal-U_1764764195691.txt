You are the AI dev agent for this Replit project.

Goal: Update this codebase into a marketing / documentation site for **Verifiable Systems Group (VSG)** with a clean, institutional IA (information architecture) and routing. DO NOT change the existing visual design system, theme tokens, or component library unless absolutely necessary.

### 1. Navigation + Routes (source of truth)

Implement the following top-level navigation and routes:

TOP NAV (desktop):
- Overview  → route: `/`
- Ventures ▾
  - Ventures (overview) → `/ventures`
  - Helios → `/ventures/helios`
  - Axiom → `/ventures/axiom`
  - Stackme → `/ventures/stackme`
  - Lumina → `/ventures/lumina`
  - Uniqueness → `/ventures/uniqueness`
- Approach ▾
  - Pillars → `/approach/pillars`
  - Process → `/approach/process`
  - Standards → `/approach/standards`
- Studio ▾
  - Studio (overview) → `/studio`
  - Purpose → `/studio/purpose`
  - Vision → `/studio/vision`
  - Mission → `/studio/mission`
- Insights → `/insights`
- Connect → `/connect`

Requirements:
- The top-level nav items **Overview, Ventures, Approach, Studio, Insights, Connect** must all be clickable and mapped to real pages.
- Ventures, Approach, and Studio should display dropdown menus on hover (desktop) / tap (mobile) with the subpages listed above.
- Re-use any existing layout / header / nav components if present. If you create new ones, keep them consistent with the existing design system (same typography, colors, spacing conventions).

### 2. Routing implementation

- Create the routes/pages listed above using the existing framework in this repo (e.g., React Router / Next.js / whatever is already in use). DO NOT switch frameworks.
- For now, it is OK if each new page just returns a simple placeholder layout like:
  - Page title (e.g., “Ventures”)
  - One short sentence: “This page is under construction.”
- Make sure the routes are wired correctly so every nav item and dropdown link works.

### 3. Code quality

- Keep code DRY: use shared layout components where appropriate.
- Do NOT introduce new design tokens or global CSS resets.
- At the end, briefly list:
  - Files created
  - Files modified
  - Any TODOs or assumptions you made

Please implement these changes now.
