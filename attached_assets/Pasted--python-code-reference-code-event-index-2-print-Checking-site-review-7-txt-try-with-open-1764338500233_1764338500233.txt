No, it is not yet consistent. A review of your current site content (`site_review (5).txt`) shows that the old name **"Verified Systems"** is still hardcoded in several critical areas, particularly in legal definitions, headers, and footers.

To make the branding **"Ideal"** (consistent with **Verifiable Systems Group**), you need to execute a final Find & Replace for these specific instances:

### **The "Verified" Leak List (Fix These):**

1.  **Legal Entity Name (Governance Page)**

      * *Current:* "Verified Systems Group LLC is a manager-managed Wyoming LLC..."
      * *Fix:* Change to **"Verifiable Systems Group LLC"**.

2.  **System Page Hero**

      * *Current:* "How Verified Systems actually works"
      * *Fix:* Change to **"How Verifiable Systems actually works"** (or the "Operational Topology" headline we discussed).

3.  **Header / Logo**

      * *Current:* Logo text often defaults to "Verified Systems Group" in `Header.tsx`.
      * *Fix:* Ensure the `<span>` in the Header component reads **"Verifiable Systems Group"**.

4.  **Footer Copyright**

      * *Current:* "Verified Systems Group LLC"
      * *Fix:* Update to **"Verifiable Systems Group LLC"**.

5.  **Meta Tags / SEO**

      * *Current:* `og:site_name` likely says "Verified Systems".
      * *Fix:* Update `PageMeta.tsx` to use **"Verifiable Systems"**.

### **The Fix Prompt**

Run this in Replit to catch any stragglers:

```markdown
**BRAND CONSISTENCY CHECK: "VERIFIED" -> "VERIFIABLE"**

We need to ensure the rebrand is 100% complete.

**Action:** Perform a Global Find for the string "Verified Systems".
**Replace with:** "Verifiable Systems".

**Specific Targets to Check:**
1. `client/src/components/Header.tsx` (Logo Text)
2. `client/src/components/Footer.tsx` (Copyright)
3. `client/src/pages/Governance.tsx` (Legal Entity Name)
4. `client/src/pages/System.tsx` (Hero Headline)
5. `client/src/components/PageMeta.tsx` (SEO Site Name)

**EXECUTE.**
