This is the **Final Copy Deck (v7.0)**.

I have performed a final polish on every sentence to ensure maximum impact and clarity. This document allows you to copy and paste the exact text directly into your Replit code (e.g., into your `Overview.tsx`, `System.tsx`, or `projects.ts` files).

### **INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPLIT**

### **2. PAGE: MISSION (formerly Overview)**
**File:** `client/src/pages/Overview.tsx`

**Hero Section**
* **Headline:** The Trust Layer for AI and Finance.
* **Subhead:** We engineer infrastructure that ensures Artificial Intelligence is accurate and digital assets are secure. Every system is backed by our own capital—aligning our risk with yours.
* **Primary Button:** See Our Ventures
* **Secondary Button:** Audio Overview

**Section: Core Objectives (The "Why Us")**
* **Card 1 Title:** Eroding Trust
* **Card 1 Body:** Digital markets are flooded with hallucinated data and unstable assets. In this environment, verifiable truth is the only scarce resource.
* **Card 2 Title:** Cryptographic Verification
* **Card 2 Body:** We replace human trust with mathematical proof. Our systems verify their own solvency, data lineage, and asset ownership.
* **Card 3 Title:** Proof of Capital
* **Card 3 Body:** We do not rely on theory. We deploy our own Bitcoin treasury to validate our systems before opening them to external partners.

**Section: System Axioms (Operating Principles)**
* **Principle 1:** Don't Trust, Verify.
    * *Description:* We validate every assumption against market reality. If a system cannot survive the wild, we do not deploy it.
* **Principle 2:** Backed by Value.
    * *Description:* We reject empty hype. Every project is anchored by real resources and internal funding.
* **Principle 3:** Bounded Execution.
    * *Description:* Innovation requires constraints. We code strict limits into our software to prevent systemic failures.
* **Principle 4:** Open Intelligence.
    * *Description:* A transparent market is a resilient market. We publish our research to help partners navigate the noise.
* **Principle 5:** Future Proof.
    * *Description:* We architect for the next decade of autonomous agents, not just the manual tools of today.
* **Principle 6:** Signal Integrity.
    * *Description:* We protect our partners by focusing on technical reality rather than narrative cycles.

### **3. PAGE: PROCESS (formerly System)**
**File:** `client/src/pages/System.tsx`

**Hero Section**
* **Headline:** Our Process
* **Body:** We operate as a venture studio. By utilizing shared infrastructure across multiple specialized companies, we achieve high velocity without compromising security.

**Section: The Lexicon (Definitions)**
* **Term 1:** Verifiable Systems
    * *Definition:* Infrastructure that is fully auditable. No black boxes; the logic is visible, the risk is defined, and the outcome is provable.
* **Term 2:** Cited AI
    * *Definition:* Artificial Intelligence that anchors its outputs to verified documents, eliminating hallucination.
* **Term 3:** Bearer Assets
    * *Definition:* Digital assets with absolute ownership rights, capable of moving freely without intermediary permission.

**Section: The Treasury**
* **Headline:** Powered by Bitcoin.
* **Body:** Bitcoin serves as our reserve asset. Rather than liquidating capital to fund operations, we utilize responsible, over-collateralized borrowing. This sustains our long-term balance sheet while funding continuous innovation.
