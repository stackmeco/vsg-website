You’re right to push on this—Process is one of the core “spines” of the site, so it needs to be mechanically clean *and* on-brand.

I’ll do two things:

1. **Tighten the Process page content spec** (clearer, more scannable, safer, more in line with current enterprise + UX best practices).
2. **Improve the Replit agent prompt** so it’s less brittle and more “do exactly this, nothing more”.

I’ll explicitly bake in what we know from current UX and enterprise-site guidance: short paragraphs, strong headings, scannable lists, no over-sharing of internals, no “security by obscurity” reliance.

---

## 1. Improved Process page content (public + safe + scannable)

This keeps the **same layout and components** you already have in `Process.tsx` and just upgrades the strings and data structures.

### 1.1 Page meta

Keep the meta component, but make the description do more work in search/snippets.

```tsx
<PageMeta
  title="Process"
  description="How Verifiable Systems Group moves ventures from concept to governed, verifiable systems using a six-stage, Bitcoin-backed R&D process."
  preloadImage="/hero-texture.png"
/>
```

* Starts with the key idea (“how VSG moves ventures…”), which matches guidance that the first sentence should front-load the main info for scanning and SEO.

---

### 1.2 Hero section (clear promise, scannable, no fluff)

Update only the **text**, not the structure/classes.

**Overline:**

```tsx
<p className="text-xs font-medium uppercase tracking-[0.2em] text-muted-foreground">
  How ventures move inside VSG
</p>
```

**Heading:**

```tsx
<h1 className="text-balance text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight sm:text-4xl lg:text-5xl">
  A six-stage runway for verifiable ventures.
</h1>
```

**Body copy:**

```tsx
<p className="mt-4 max-w-2xl text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground sm:text-base">
  Every venture at VSG follows the same six-stage path. We define and validate the problem, build and deploy under tight controls, then evolve and recurse based on real signals so risk is surfaced early and knowledge compounds instead of resetting with each project.
</p>
```

Why this is better:

* First sentence says **exactly** what this page is.
* Sentences are short, with one idea each, which helps scannability and comprehension.

---

### 1.3 Stages (single words, even reading weight, UX-friendly)

We keep your 6-stage pattern, but refine the copy so:

* Each description is one tight sentence.
* Line lengths are roughly similar, following guidance for bullet/list balance.

Replace the `stages` constant with:

```ts
const stages = [
  {
    name: "Define",
    focus: "Strategy & Alignment",
    description:
      "Clarify the problem, constraints, and regulatory surface so we know exactly who we serve, what is at stake, and when the venture should not exist.",
  },
  {
    name: "Validate",
    focus: "Risk & Signal",
    description:
      "Run small, low-risk experiments to test the core assumptions first, using models, prototypes, and controlled simulations instead of full production builds.",
  },
  {
    name: "Build",
    focus: "Security & Quality",
    description:
      "Engineer in short, verifiable increments with automated checks, threat modelling, and failure paths designed in from the start so every change is explainable.",
  },
  {
    name: "Deploy",
    focus: "Governed Launch",
    description:
      "Release into a controlled environment with clear guardrails, observability, and rollback so launch behaves like a structured experiment, not a cliff jump.",
  },
  {
    name: "Evolve",
    focus: "Data & Optimization",
    description:
      "Use live telemetry, behaviour, and incidents to refine the system so ventures either mature into durable infrastructure or are retired with clean exits.",
  },
  {
    name: "Recurse",
    focus: "Institutional Memory",
    description:
      "Treat anomalies and failures as high-value signals by running structured post-mortems and feeding the lessons back into our standards and pipeline.",
  },
];
```

Then update the explanatory sentence under the stage grid to:

```tsx
<p className="mt-6 max-w-2xl text-sm text-muted-foreground sm:text-base">
  Ventures do not “graduate” by default. After moving through all six stages, they are either adopted as durable infrastructure, wrapped in ongoing governance, or archived with their lessons integrated into our standards and research backlog.
</p>
```

This keeps the **recursive learning** philosophy but expresses it in language that reads like a real enterprise playbook.

---

### 1.4 Definitions (“System primitives” / core concepts)

We keep the three-card layout but make the definitions sharper and more distinct, so each card clearly answers “what does this **mean** in our context?” and doesn’t blur together.

Replace `definitions` with:

```ts
const definitions = [
  {
    term: "Verifiable Systems",
    definition:
      "Systems where critical behaviours can be inspected and, where it matters, formally or empirically proven. Capital flows, access controls, and decision paths must be observable—not hidden inside opaque services.",
  },
  {
    term: "Deterministic AI",
    definition:
      "AI that behaves like infrastructure, not a slot machine. Narrow in scope, grounded in governed data, and constrained to repeatable, auditable outputs instead of open-ended guesswork.",
  },
  {
    term: "Non-custodial Rails",
    definition:
      "Financial and identity rails where institutions and individuals retain control of keys and governance. Our systems orchestrate workflows and verification; they do not take custody of customer assets.",
  },
];
```

Alignment with current best practice:

* Focused, one-idea sentences per card, which is recommended for scannable content.
* Clear differentiation between the three terms (they don’t sound like synonyms).

---

### 1.5 Bitcoin / capital strategy section (safe + clear)

We want this block to:

* Explain *why* BTC matters to Process.
* Make it explicit this is **internal-only**, non-custodial, and conservative.
* Stay away from numeric risk dials that could drift over time or look like marketing.

Keep your existing layout and image texture, but change the **copy** inside that section to:

**Overline:**

```tsx
<p className="text-xs font-medium uppercase tracking-[0.2em] text-muted-foreground">
  Capital Strategy
</p>
```

**Heading:**

```tsx
<h2 className="mt-3 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight sm:text-3xl">
  Bitcoin as long-term reserve, not a trading thesis.
</h2>
```

**Lead paragraph:**

```tsx
<p className="mt-4 max-w-xl text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground sm:text-base">
  Bitcoin is our primary long-term reserve asset. When appropriate, we selectively borrow against it under conservative limits to fund research, infrastructure, and security work so we can keep long-term exposure while still shipping useful systems in the present.
</p>
```

**Bullets (3 items, similar length):**

```tsx
<ul className="mt-4 space-y-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground sm:text-base">
  <li>Fund deep research, security reviews, and shared infrastructure across our ventures.</li>
  <li>Maintain an operating runway that is less exposed to short-term revenue volatility.</li>
  <li>Absorb shocks so individual ventures can be evaluated on their merits, not on market noise.</li>
</ul>
```

This follows guidance that bullets should be visually similar and focused on key benefits.

**Closing note (very important for safety):**

```tsx
<p className="mt-4 text-xs italic text-muted-foreground">
  This is an internal treasury program. We do not pool client funds, manage outside capital, or offer yield products.
</p>
```

That language is well aligned with how real-world crypto treasury guides tell companies to talk about internal BTC treasuries and multi-sig setups: emphasize conservative risk, diversification, and clear separation from customer assets.

---

### 1.6 Content hygiene

In **this file only**, the agent should:

* Remove any remaining `...` / `[…]` placeholder text.
* Ensure every string is a complete sentence or clear phrase.
* Not add or remove sections/layout—this preserves your global visual system, which matters for enterprise consistency.

---

## 2. Improved Replit agent prompt (more precise, less risk of drift)

Below is an updated version of the prompt you give the Replit AI agent for this checkpoint. It:

* Emphasizes **no design or routing changes** beyond what we specify.
* Asks the agent to run a quick compile/type-check.
* Explicitly calls out placeholder removal and copy completeness.

You can copy-paste this as-is.

---

### ✅ Replit AI Prompt – Process Page Cleanup (Checkpoint)

> **Project:** `Verifiable-Systems-Group` (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, routing via `wouter` in `client/src/App.tsx`).
>
> **Goal for this checkpoint**
>
> Clean up and finalize the `Process` page so it reflects VSG’s 6-stage venture pipeline and internal Bitcoin-backed capital strategy in clear, scannable language. Also fix one small navigation bug in `Standards.tsx`.
>
> **Do not** change any global theming, layout primitives, or add/remove routes. Only touch the files and sections below.

---

#### 1) Update `client/src/pages/Process.tsx`

**a. PageMeta**

* Keep `title="Process"` and `preloadImage="/hero-texture.png"`.
* Set the `description` prop to:

```tsx
description="How Verifiable Systems Group moves ventures from concept to governed, verifiable systems using a six-stage, Bitcoin-backed R&D process."
```

---

**b. Hero section text**

Keep the existing JSX结构 for the hero and background; just replace the strings:

* Overline text:

```tsx
"How ventures move inside VSG"
```

* Heading:

```tsx
"A six-stage runway for verifiable ventures."
```

* Body paragraph:

```tsx
"Every venture at VSG follows the same six-stage path. We define and validate the problem, build and deploy under tight controls, then evolve and recurse based on real signals so risk is surfaced early and knowledge compounds instead of resetting with each project."
```

Do not change classes or container structure.

---

**c. Replace the `stages` constant**

Replace the existing `const stages = [...]` definition with:

```ts
const stages = [
  {
    name: "Define",
    focus: "Strategy & Alignment",
    description:
      "Clarify the problem, constraints, and regulatory surface so we know exactly who we serve, what is at stake, and when the venture should not exist.",
  },
  {
    name: "Validate",
    focus: "Risk & Signal",
    description:
      "Run small, low-risk experiments to test the core assumptions first, using models, prototypes, and controlled simulations instead of full production builds.",
  },
  {
    name: "Build",
    focus: "Security & Quality",
    description:
      "Engineer in short, verifiable increments with automated checks, threat modelling, and failure paths designed in from the start so every change is explainable.",
  },
  {
    name: "Deploy",
    focus: "Governed Launch",
    description:
      "Release into a controlled environment with clear guardrails, observability, and rollback so launch behaves like a structured experiment, not a cliff jump.",
  },
  {
    name: "Evolve",
    focus: "Data & Optimization",
    description:
      "Use live telemetry, behaviour, and incidents to refine the system so ventures either mature into durable infrastructure or are retired with clean exits.",
  },
  {
    name: "Recurse",
    focus: "Institutional Memory",
    description:
      "Treat anomalies and failures as high-value signals by running structured post-mortems and feeding the lessons back into our standards and pipeline.",
  },
];
```

Leave the `StepCard` component as-is; it should continue to map over `stages`.

Under the stages grid, update the explanatory paragraph to:

```tsx
"Ventures do not “graduate” by default. After moving through all six stages, they are either adopted as durable infrastructure, wrapped in ongoing governance, or archived with their lessons integrated into our standards and research backlog."
```

---

**d. Replace the `definitions` constant**

Replace `const definitions = [...]` with:

```ts
const definitions = [
  {
    term: "Verifiable Systems",
    definition:
      "Systems where critical behaviours can be inspected and, where it matters, formally or empirically proven. Capital flows, access controls, and decision paths must be observable—not hidden inside opaque services.",
  },
  {
    term: "Deterministic AI",
    definition:
      "AI that behaves like infrastructure, not a slot machine. Narrow in scope, grounded in governed data, and constrained to repeatable, auditable outputs instead of open-ended guesswork.",
  },
  {
    term: "Non-custodial Rails",
    definition:
      "Financial and identity rails where institutions and individuals retain control of keys and governance. Our systems orchestrate workflows and verification; they do not take custody of customer assets.",
  },
];
```

Do not change the JSX that maps over `definitions`, only the data.

---

**e. Update the Bitcoin / capital strategy section**

Locate the “Powered by Bitcoin” / capital strategy block in `Process.tsx`. Keep the overall layout and background image, but update text nodes as follows:

* Overline:

```tsx
"Capital Strategy"
```

* Heading:

```tsx
"Bitcoin as long-term reserve, not a trading thesis."
```

* Intro paragraph:

```tsx
"Bitcoin is our primary long-term reserve asset. When appropriate, we selectively borrow against it under conservative limits to fund research, infrastructure, and security work so we can keep long-term exposure while still shipping useful systems in the present."
```

* Bullet list items (three LI elements):

```tsx
"Fund deep research, security reviews, and shared infrastructure across our ventures."
"Maintain an operating runway that is less exposed to short-term revenue volatility."
"Absorb shocks so individual ventures can be evaluated on their merits, not on market noise."
```

* Closing note (italic paragraph):

```tsx
"This is an internal treasury program. We do not pool client funds, manage outside capital, or offer yield products."
```

**Important:** Remove any `...` or truncated strings in this section so all copy is complete sentences.

---

**f. Content hygiene in `Process.tsx`**

* Ensure there are **no placeholder ellipses (`...`)** left anywhere in `Process.tsx`.
* Do not add new sections or components.

---

#### 2) Fix the `/library` 404 on Standards page

File: `client/src/pages/Standards.tsx`

At the bottom of the file there is a `NextStepBlock` configured to point at `/library`. This route does not exist; the correct collection is `/insights` (per `App.tsx`).

Update that block to:

```tsx
<NextStepBlock
  nextPage="Insights"
  description="Read our notes, research, and updates."
  href="/insights"
/>
```

Do not change any other content or layout in `Standards.tsx`.

---

#### 3) Quality checks

After making these edits:

1. Run the dev server and visit `/process` to confirm:

   * The hero, stages, definitions, and capital strategy sections render with the new copy.
   * There are no TypeScript or runtime errors from these changes.

2. Visit `/standards` and click the bottom CTA:

   * Confirm it now routes to `/insights` without a 404.

3. Confirm that no other pages, styles, or routes have been modified in this checkpoint.

---

If you’d like, once this is landed we can repeat this level of **surgery + precise agent prompt** for:

* `Pillars` (turn it from Placeholder into the 3 core pillars we defined in the identity doc), and
* The **Ventures overview** + Helios detail page, now that we’ve locked a safe, public voice for Helios.
