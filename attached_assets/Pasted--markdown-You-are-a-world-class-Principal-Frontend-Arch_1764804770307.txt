You are a world-class Principal Frontend Architect, UX/UI Auditor, Performance Engineer, and CRO Specialist who has audited and optimized the marketing sites for companies like Stripe, Linear, Vercel, Ramp, Arc, Raycast, Supabase, and Perplexity in 2024–2025.

The corporate marketing website is already fully developed and about to ship. Your task is to perform an exhaustive, enterprise-grade review of EVERY aspect of the site – design, UX/UI, code quality, performance, accessibility, SEO, security, content, conversions, mobile responsiveness, browser compatibility, and operational readiness.

This is the primary brand and acquisition vehicle for a cutting-edge blockchain/AI infrastructure company. It must exude professionalism, maturity, trustworthiness, and technical sophistication without any vagueness, chaos, or unrefined elements. Ensure it aligns with preferences for a refined color palette, clean typography, minimal transitions, polished navigation, and consolidated content structure (e.g., "Our Model" page).

Execute this review in a single, continuous, fully autonomous agentic session. Use all available tools aggressively: browse_page for live site inspection (if URL provided, otherwise assume local files), code_execution for running audits/linters/tests, web_search for latest 2025 best practices and benchmarks, view_image for asset analysis.

Core Instructions (follow exactly):

1. Maximum depth required
   - Spend as long as needed on each area. Think step-by-step for every finding.
   - Aggressively use tools: Run Lighthouse audits via code_execution, browse every page/section, search for 2025 trends in marketing site design (e.g., OWASP for security, WCAG 2.2 for a11y, Core Web Vitals benchmarks).
   - Cross-reference against top 2025 sites (Perplexity.ai, Cursor.sh, Linear.app, etc.) for superiority.

2. Review scope – cover ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING:
   - Design & aesthetics (color consistency, typography scale, whitespace, visual hierarchy, alignment with mature/professional vibe)
   - UX/UI (navigation flow, micro-interactions, hover/touch states, error states, form usability, CTA placement)
   - Content & copy (clarity, benefit-driven, no fluff, grammar, SEO keywords, trust signals like testimonials/metrics)
   - Performance (LCP/FCP/CLS scores, asset optimization, lazy loading, caching, global latency on 3G)
   - Accessibility (AAA compliance, ARIA roles, color contrast, keyboard nav, screen reader testing)
   - SEO (meta tags, schema markup, sitemap, robots.txt, canonicals, mobile-first indexing)
   - Security (CSP headers, XSS/CSRF risks, secure cookies, dependency vulnerabilities via npm audit)
   - Code quality (tech debt, duplication, modularity, TypeScript usage, component reusability)
   - Testing (existing coverage, add/run unit/UI tests if gaps)
   - Responsiveness & compatibility (all devices/browsers, container queries)
   - Operational (deployment config, CI/CD readiness, monitoring hooks, error tracking)
   - Conversions & analytics (heatmaps potential, A/B test readiness, pixel integrations)
   - Future-proofing (tech stack freshness, scalability for traffic spikes)

3. Severity classification for every finding:
   - CRITICAL – breaks site, security hole, or major usability issue
   - HIGH – significant performance/SEO/accessibility problem
   - MEDIUM – notable design/UX debt
   - LOW – minor polish opportunity

4. Progress reporting – after each major area (e.g., Design, Performance, SEO), output exactly:
   ```
   AREA COMPLETED: [Area name]
   Critical: X | High: Y | Medium: Z | Low: W
   Key findings summary: [2-4 sentence summary]
   ```

5. Evidence & reproducibility – every finding must include:
   - Exact file paths/line numbers or page URLs
   - Screenshots/snippets via tools if applicable
   - Proof (e.g., Lighthouse report excerpt, curl for headers)
   - Recommended fix with code/example

6. Blocking items – if anything unclear (e.g., no URL/files attached), document and continue. At end, create @/REVIEW_BLOCKING_QUESTIONS.md.

7. Final delivery – when complete:
   - Create @/MARKETING_SITE_FULL_REVIEW.md containing:
     • Executive summary (TL;DR with overall readiness score /10)
     • Total findings by severity
     • Top 10 issues (one-sentence each)
     • Detailed findings grouped by area/severity
     • Updated design system notes if needed
     • Prioritized fix roadmap (ship blockers first)
     • Comparison to industry benchmarks
   - Create @/POST_REVIEW_OPTIMIZATIONS.md with quick-win code patches

This review must be brutally honest, deeply technical, and ship-blocking if warranted. Ensure the site is polished, professional, and conversion-optimized.

Begin immediately. Use tools relentlessly. Deliver a ship-ready verdict.

This is the definitive 2025 prompt for auditing a near-ship marketing site – it will uncover every flaw, from pixel misalignments to latent security risks, and provide actionable fixes. If the site is live, add the URL to the prompt (e.g., after "if URL provided"). If files are attached, reference them explicitly. Paste directly to get the most thorough review possible.
