Project: Verifiable-Systems-Group (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, routing via wouter in client/src/App.tsx).

Goal for this checkpoint

Rename the sixth stage in our six-stage runway from “Recurse” to “Learn” everywhere it appears as a stage name, and update its description to better fit the VSG v3.0 voice. Do not change layout, styling, routes, or the number of stages.

Important: This is a naming/wording cleanup only. The underlying concept remains “institutional learning from incidents and post-mortems.”

---

1) Update Process page stages

File: `client/src/pages/Process.tsx` (or the equivalent Process page file)

- Find the `const stages = [...]` array used on the Process page.
- Leave the first five stages (Define, Validate, Build, Deploy, Evolve) exactly as they are.
- Replace ONLY the sixth stage object with this:

  {
    name: "Learn",
    focus: "Institutional Learning",
    description:
      "Treat anomalies and failures as high-value signals by running structured post-mortems and feeding the lessons back into our standards, playbooks, and runway so we do not repeat the same failure twice.",
  },

- Do NOT change the StepCard component or the mapping logic.
- Ensure the UI still shows six stages and that the sixth one is labeled “Learn”.

---

2) Fix any “Recurse” references on the Process page

Still in the Process page file:

- Search for the word `Recurse` in headings, body copy, or explanatory paragraphs.
- If you find any text that refers to the sixth stage by name, update it to use “Learn” instead.

Example (if present, adjust as needed):

- Change any wording like “from Define to Recurse” to “from Define to Learn”.
- Change any wording like “Recurse is where we…” to “Learn is where we…”.

Do NOT remove or add stages. Only rename.

---

3) Global hygiene: “Recurse” as stage name

Run a project-wide search for the exact string `Recurse`.

For each hit:

- If it is clearly referring to the **sixth stage in the runway**, rename it to `Learn`.
  - Example: lists like “Define, Validate, Build, Deploy, Evolve, Recurse” should become “Define, Validate, Build, Deploy, Evolve, Learn”.
  - Example: tooltips or labels like “Stage: Recurse” should become “Stage: Learn”.

- If the word “recurse” appears in any code comments or technical explanations unrelated to the runway (e.g., describing recursive algorithms), leave it alone. This checkpoint only cares about stage names.

Do NOT change any other stage names or numbers.

---

4) Quality checks

After edits:

1. Run the dev server and visit `/process`:
   - Confirm the stage labels in the UI are, in order:
     Define · Validate · Build · Deploy · Evolve · Learn.
   - Confirm the sixth stage card shows the new “Institutional Learning” description.

2. Visit any pages that list all six stages (if they exist, e.g. Approach or overview pages):
   - Confirm they say “Learn” as the final stage instead of “Recurse”.

3. Ensure there are no TypeScript or runtime errors from these changes.

Do not modify colors, layout, or add/remove sections as part of this checkpoint.
