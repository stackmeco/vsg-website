This is the "Nuclear Option" for fixing the size.

The reason it looks small is that we changed the **Physics of the Universe** (`html { font-size: 14px }`). This shrunk **everything**—padding, margins, buttons, and text—by 12.5%.

We need to **Reset the Universe** to standard (16px) but keep the **Typography** tight.

Here is the **"Standard Size, Tight Feel"** protocol. This makes the text readable (16px) but keeps the "Control Room" vibe via font choice and tracking, not by making it microscopic.

### **The Fix: Restore 16px Root**

**Copy/Paste this into Replit.** It reverts the global shrink ray but keeps the industrial styling.

**VISUAL CORRECTION: RESTORE STANDARD SIZE**

The "Global Shrink" was too aggressive. We need to return to standard web sizing (16px) for readability, but enforce "Industrial" styling via font weights and tracking.

**Action:** Update `client/src/index.css`. Replace the `@layer base` block with this:

```css
@layer base {
  /* 1. RESTORE STANDARD PHYSICS */
  html {
    font-family: 'Manrope', sans-serif;
    font-size: 16px; /* Standard Web Size (Was 14px) */
    letter-spacing: -0.01em; 
    color: hsl(var(--foreground));
  }

  body {
    @apply bg-background text-foreground antialiased;
  }

  /* 2. COMFORTABLE BODY TEXT */
  /* This will now render at 16px (readable), but tight. */
  p {
    @apply text-base leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground/90; 
    margin-bottom: 0.75rem;
  }

  /* 3. DISTINCT HEADINGS */
  h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
    font-family: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif;
    font-weight: 600;
    color: #ffffff;
    @apply tracking-tight;
  }
  
  h1 { @apply text-4xl md:text-5xl mb-6; }
  h2 { @apply text-3xl md:text-4xl mb-4; } /* Bumped up */
  h3 { @apply text-xl mb-3; } 

  /* 4. METADATA (The "Small" Text) */
  /* This stays small (14px) to differentiate it from Body */
  .text-muted-foreground {
    @apply text-sm; 
  }

  /* 5. LABELS (The "Tiny" Text) */
  /* Used for "SYSTEM STATUS" type labels */
  .text-label {
    @apply text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-[0.2em] text-muted-foreground/70;
  }
}
````

**Action 2:** Update `tailwind.config.ts` to remove the custom `fontSize` overrides if they exist, or reset them to default. (If you pasted the "Industrial Scale" block previously, delete the `fontSize: { ... }` block entirely to let Tailwind use its defaults).

**EXECUTE.**

```

### **Why this works:**
* **16px Body:** It is legible on all screens.
* **Tight Tracking:** It still feels "Engineered" because we keep `letter-spacing: -0.01em`.
* **Contrast:** We kept the brighter text color (`/90`) so it pops against the black.
