Project: Verifiable-Systems-Group (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, routing via wouter in client/src/App.tsx).

Goal for this checkpoint

Align the **Ventures index page** (`/ventures`) with:

- VSG Brand & Voice System v3.0
- The Truth · Capital · Dignity model
- The Architect/Judge voice (precise, infrastructural, low-hype)
- The AI-native, internal-first, non-custodial stance

This page should:

- Introduce ventures as **proofs of how we answer Truth, Capital, and Dignity**, not as “products” to buy.
- Make it clear all ventures are **run on our own balance sheet / in our own environments first**.
- Present each venture card (Helios, Lumina, Uniqueness Engine) with:
  - A domain label (Truth / Capital / Dignity)
  - A tight tagline
  - A concise, mechanics-forward description
- Avoid all legacy language (Signal/Value/Human, StackMe, VSP, generic AI hype).

Do NOT change global theming, layout primitives, or add/remove routes. Only update the Ventures index page file and any local data file it uses.

--------------------------------------------------
1) Locate the Ventures index page and data
--------------------------------------------------

1. Find the React component that renders the **/ventures** route, e.g.:

   - client/src/pages/Ventures.tsx
   - or similar, as referenced in client/src/App.tsx.

2. If the page uses a separate data file for ventures (for example `client/src/data/ventures.ts` or a `const ventures = [...]` inside the page), you may edit that data structure as described below, but do not change its TypeScript types or export shape.

All instructions below apply to:

- The Ventures page component (layout + hero + section intro).
- The ventures list data (titles, labels, descriptions, hrefs).

--------------------------------------------------
2) Update PageMeta on /ventures
--------------------------------------------------

In the Ventures page component, locate the `PageMeta` (or equivalent) and set:

- title:
    "Ventures"
- description:
    "Ventures from Verifiable Systems Group that pressure-test our answers to Truth, Capital, and Dignity—run on our own balance sheet and environments first."

Keep `preloadImage` or other props as they are.

Do not modify imports or component structure; only update the string props.

--------------------------------------------------
3) Hero section – clarify what “Ventures” means
--------------------------------------------------

Keep the existing layout (background texture, columns, etc.) but replace only text and hrefs.

Overline:
  "Ventures · Studio"

Main heading:
  "Ventures, tested on our balance sheet first."

Body paragraph:
  "Each venture is a focused system that answers a specific question about Truth, Capital, or Dignity. We run them on our own balance sheet and environments first, refine them under explicit constraints, and only then share the patterns."

Optional warmth line under the body (if layout supports a second paragraph):
  "You shouldn’t have to trust untested rails—we start with our own exposure."

Hero CTAs:

Primary CTA button:
  Label:
    "See how we build"
  href:
    "/process"

Secondary CTA (if present):
  Label:
    "Read field notes"
  href:
    "/insights"

Do not change hero layout or component types—only these strings and hrefs.

--------------------------------------------------
4) Section intro above the ventures grid
--------------------------------------------------

If there is a short intro above the ventures list/grid, replace it with:

Heading:
  "Three questions, three proof points."

Intro paragraph:
  "We organize our work around three questions: What can be trusted? How should capital move? How do people participate without overexposure? Helios, Lumina, and the Uniqueness Engine are concrete answers—ventures that turn those questions into running systems."

Keep this to a single paragraph (≤70 words).

If there is no such intro currently, add this block immediately above the ventures grid/list using existing typography components (e.g., <h2>, <p>, or shared section header components).

--------------------------------------------------
5) Update the ventures list data
--------------------------------------------------

Locate the data structure that drives the ventures cards, for example:

- `const ventures = [...]` in the Ventures page; or
- `export const ventures = [...]` in client/src/data/ventures.ts.

Do NOT change its TypeScript type or how it is exported/imported—only update the string fields and hrefs.

For each venture, configure as follows (adapt field names to match existing structure — e.g. `name`, `label`, `tagline`, `description`, `href`):

1) Helios

- name:
    "Helios"
- label (short meta line under/above title, if present):
    "Capital · Internal venture"
- tagline (if there is a short subtitle field):
    "Treasury execution under explicit constraints."
- description:
    "Helios is our internal execution engine for digital asset treasuries—routing positions across approved venues under predefined limits so capital stays resilient under stress instead of drifting into hidden exposures."
- href (card link target):
    "/ventures/helios"

2) Lumina

- name:
    "Lumina"
- label:
    "Truth · Venture"
- tagline:
    "Physics-aware grading infrastructure."
- description:
    "Lumina turns the condition of physical assets into structured, verifiable signals—captured from your own devices—so grading, insurance, and pricing workflows can rely on evidence instead of one-time, opaque judgments."
- href:
    "/ventures/lumina"

3) Uniqueness Engine

- name:
    "Uniqueness Engine"
- label:
    "Dignity · Venture"
- tagline:
    "Personhood without exposure."
- description:
    "The Uniqueness Engine enforces one-person-one-presence in governed systems—proving uniqueness in context without demanding full dossiers, over-collecting identity data, or turning people into product."
- href:
    "/ventures/uniqueness"

Keep any icon references, accent colors, or layout-related properties as they are. Only change text and paths.

--------------------------------------------------
6) Optional supporting text below the ventures grid
--------------------------------------------------

If the page has a small explanatory paragraph or note under the ventures grid (or you can add one without changing layout), use:

Paragraph:
  "We treat each venture as a live proof of how we think about Truth, Capital, and Dignity. Patterns that hold up under real conditions become part of our shared standards; those that do not are documented, retired, and folded into our internal playbooks."

Keep this as a single paragraph. If there is already copy there, replace it; do not add a second long block.

--------------------------------------------------
7) Bottom “Next steps” / CTA block on /ventures
--------------------------------------------------

At the bottom of the Ventures page, above the footer, use the same CTA pattern used elsewhere (e.g. <NextStepBlock>).

Configure it as:

  <NextStepBlock
    nextPage="Approach"
    description="See how we decide which questions become ventures—and how they move through our six-stage runway."
    href="/approach"
  />

If the page already has a CTA component, keep the component and layout but update its text to match the same intent:

- Title/label:
    "Explore our approach"
- Description:
    "See how ventures like Helios, Lumina, and the Uniqueness Engine move from concept to governed systems."
- href:
    "/approach"

--------------------------------------------------
8) Hygiene & brand checks for /ventures
--------------------------------------------------

In the Ventures page file and any associated data file:

1) Ensure there are **no** occurrences of:
   - The old domains "Signal", "Value", "Human" as domain names.
   - The phrase "validate the signal".
   - Phrases like "AI-powered platform", "revolutionary AI", "AI magic", "game-changing agents".
   - "move fast and break things".
   - "StackMe", "Stackme Holdings", "Stackme app", or "VSP" as active brand names.
   - The standalone phrase "the human" as a noun; prefer “people”, “participants”, or “personhood”.

2) Ensure you do **not**:
   - Describe any venture as a fund, yield product, or public investment offering.
   - Mention specific protocols, tickers, bank names, or wiring details on this index page.
   - Make promises about returns, grades, or regulatory outcomes.

3) Ensure you **do**:
   - Explicitly frame ventures as being run on our own balance sheet / environments first.
   - Tie each venture clearly to one of: Truth, Capital, Dignity (via labels/taglines).
   - Maintain the Architect/Judge voice: calm, precise, infrastructural, with at most one “you shouldn’t have to…” style warmth line in the hero or section intro.

Do not modify other pages or routes in this checkpoint.
