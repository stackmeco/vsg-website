Project: Verifiable-Systems-Group (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, routing via wouter in client/src/App.tsx).

Update the **Lumina venture detail page** copy so it matches the new brand and Truth · Capital · Dignity model.

File: the page used for the Lumina venture (for example `client/src/pages/Lumina.tsx` or a Lumina detail component under `/ventures`). If the name is different, locate the component actually used when you click into Lumina from `/ventures` and apply these changes there.

Do NOT change layout, components, or routes. Only update text content.

---

1) Hero section (top of Lumina page)

Keep the existing structure (overline, h1, paragraph, CTA if present). Replace only the text:

- Overline:
  "Venture · Truth"

- Heading:
  "Lumina — physics-aware grading you can inspect."

- Body paragraph:
  "Lumina turns raw card condition into evidence-backed grading signals instead of vibes. It ties every score to verifiable inputs—sensor data, checks, and logs—so you can see why a grade happened, not just accept it."

---

2) “What Lumina does” section

Locate the first descriptive section after the hero (or create one using the existing layout pattern). Use your existing card/column components but swap the text for:

Section heading:
  "What Lumina does"

Three short items:

1. Title: "Evidence-first grading"
   Text:
   "Lumina starts from measurements, not impressions. Condition data is captured and processed so the grade can be traced back to what was actually observed."

2. Title: "Consistent, not vibes"
   Text:
   "By using a repeatable pipeline, Lumina aims for the same inputs to produce the same outcomes. It reduces the randomness that comes from different days, reviewers, or moods."

3. Title: "Built for AI-native flows"
   Text:
   "Lumina is designed for an AI-native world where machines assist, but cannot improvise the rules. Models operate inside clear constraints, and their outputs are anchored to logs you can audit."

---

3) “Lumina in the Truth domain” section

Add or update a section that ties Lumina explicitly to the **Truth** domain.

Heading:
  "Lumina in the Truth domain"

Body paragraph:
  "Truth means decisions rest on evidence, not stories. In the Truth domain, Lumina is our proof: it anchors each grading decision to a trail of measurements and checks, so collectors and partners can inspect how a result was formed instead of guessing."

If a similar section already exists, keep the structure and overwrite its text with this paragraph.

---

4) Safety & brand checks for this page

On the Lumina page file only:

- Ensure there are **no** mentions of:
  - specific grading companies or brands,
  - specific protocols, venues, or token tickers,
  - promised yields, payouts, or “maximize” language.

- Ensure there are **no** occurrences of:
  - "Signal / Value / Human"
  - "validate the signal"
  - "AI-powered platform", "revolutionary AI", "game-changing agents", "AI magic"
  - "the human" as a generic object (prefer “people”, “collectors”, “participants” instead).

Keep all JSX structure, components, and styling as-is; only change the string literals and section copy.
