Project: Verifiable-Systems-Group (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, routing via wouter in client/src/App.tsx).

Update the **Process / Approach** page with:
1) A “What runs through every stage” section for Truth · Capital · Dignity.
2) A short AI-native callout.

File: the page used for the Process/Approach route (for example `client/src/pages/Process.tsx` or `client/src/pages/Approach.tsx`).

Do NOT change layout, components, or routes. Only add/update text in existing sections or simple wrappers.

---

1) Add “What runs through every stage” section

Below the six-stage grid (after the section where the `stages` cards render), add a new section using the same container/spacing pattern as the rest of the page.

Use this content (adapt to existing JSX, but keep the wording close):

Heading:
  "What runs through every stage"

Three items (cards, columns, or list items):

1. Title: "Truth"
   Body:
   "We make decisions rest on evidence, not stories, by anchoring critical behaviours to provenance and tamper-evident logs that can be inspected."

2. Title: "Capital"
   Body:
   "We preserve value by running ventures on our own balance sheet first, under conservative, non-custodial limits with clear observability and rollback paths."

3. Title: "Dignity"
   Body:
   "We protect people’s personhood and time by avoiding opaque, grind-you-down flows in favour of governed, inspectable paths that respect their constraints."

Use existing typography classes (e.g., section heading, card titles, muted body text) so this section feels cohesive with the rest of the site.

---

2) Add a short AI-native callout on this page

Add a short paragraph either:
- directly under the hero body, OR
- directly under the stages section, above “What runs through every stage”.

Use this text (or a very close variant):

"Machine intelligence scans, simulates, and flags anomalies at speed; people define the mandates, limits, and veto. We are AI-native, but control stays with people, not the model."

Make sure this is just a normal `<p>` in the existing layout (no new components needed). Use the same text style as other supporting paragraphs on the page.

---

3) Hygiene checks for this file

In this Process/Approach page file only:

- Ensure there are **no** occurrences of:
  - "Signal / Value / Human"
  - "validate the signal"
  - hypey AI phrases like "AI-powered platform", "revolutionary AI", "game-changing agents", "AI magic"
- Prefer “people” or “individuals” rather than the phrase “the human”.

Do not touch any other pages or routes in this step.
