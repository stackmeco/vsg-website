You are right to double-check this. While I defined the **"Physics"** (speed and curve), I didn't explicitly list **every component** that needs to be touched to ensure the "Control Room" feel is uniform.

If we don't specify the targets, the AI might apply the speed limit to the whole site but leave the "bouncy" default animations on things like Accordions or Mobile Menus.

Here is the **Specific Hit List** of what needs motion, followed by the **Updated Phase 6** to copy-paste.

### **The Motion "Hit List" (What gets animated)**

1.  **Interactive Surfaces (Cards & Tiles):**

      * **Trigger:** Hover.
      * **Action:** Border color snaps to Orange (`border-primary/50`). Background tint deepens slightly.
      * **Forbidden:** No lifting (Y-axis), no shadow expansion.

2.  **Command Inputs (Buttons & Links):**

      * **Trigger:** Hover / Active (Click).
      * **Action:** Instant color inversion or border light-up.
      * **Speed:** 100ms-150ms. (Instant feedback).

3.  **System Windows (Modals, Dialogs, Command Palette):**

      * **Trigger:** Open.
      * **Action:** **Fade In + Scale Up** (95% -\> 100%).
      * **Forbidden:** Sliding in from the bottom or side (unless it's a side-drawer).

4.  **Data Disclosures (Accordions & Dropdowns):**

      * **Trigger:** Click.
      * **Action:** Expand height.
      * **Timing:** `duration-200` (Slightly slower than buttons so the eye can track the content reveal, but still fast).

### **Updated Phase 6 (Copy-Paste this to replace the previous Phase 6)**

This version is much more explicit about **where** to apply the rules.

### PHASE 6: MICRO-PHYSICS & MOTION (THE "SNAP" PROTOCOL)
**Objective:** Enforce "Mechanical" timing. Remove "Organic" lags. Apply to specific components.

1.  **Define the Physics (Tailwind Config):**
    In `tailwind.config.ts`, extend `theme`:
    * **Timing:** `transitionDuration: { DEFAULT: '150ms' }` (Make 150ms the global default).
    * **Curve:** `transitionTimingFunction: { 'mechanical': 'cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)' }`.

2.  **Hard-Stop Toasts (Notifications):**
    In `client/src/components/ui/toast.tsx`:
    * Find `toastVariants`.
    * **Remove:** `slide-in-from-top-full`, `slide-in-from-bottom-full`, `slide-out-to-right-full`.
    * **Add:** `data-[state=open]:animate-in data-[state=closed]:animate-out data-[state=closed]:fade-out-0 data-[state=open]:fade-in-0 data-[state=open]:zoom-in-95`.
    * **Goal:** Notifications appear instantly (Heads-up Display style).

3.  **Window Entrances (Dialogs & Command Palette):**
    In `client/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx` and `command.tsx`:
    * Ensure `DialogContent` uses `duration-150` and `zoom-in-95`.
    * Remove any large translation values (e.g., `slide-in-from-left-1/2`). Keep it centered and snapping into existence.

4.  **Interactive Elements (Hover States):**
    * **ProjectTile / ValueCard / InsightCard:** Ensure `className` includes `transition-colors duration-150 ease-mechanical`.
    * **Buttons:** Ensure `transition-all duration-100`. (Buttons should be faster than cards).

5.  **The "Anti-Spinner" Rule:**
    * Scan codebase for `Loader2` or `animate-spin`.
    * If found in a "Loading State" (like form submission), replace with a **Pulsing Opacity** (`animate-pulse`) on the button text or a static "Processing..." label. Rotating UI elements break the "Solid State" vibe.

6.  **Terminal Text Selection:**
    In `client/src/index.css`, add:
    ```css
    ::selection {
      background-color: hsl(25 95% 53% / 0.2); /* Signal Orange at 20% opacity */
      color: #ffffff;
    }
    ```
````

### **Why this covers everything:**

  * **Step 1** sets the global speed limit to 150ms, so even if you forget a component, it defaults to "Fast."
  * **Step 2 & 3** fix the "Drifting" windows (the biggest culprit of cheap vibes).
  * **Step 6** adds that final "Developer/Hacker" polish that makes the site feel native to the OS.

**Add this to the Master Prompt and you are ready to execute.**
