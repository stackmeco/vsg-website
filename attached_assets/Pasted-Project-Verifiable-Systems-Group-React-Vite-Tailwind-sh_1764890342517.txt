Project: Verifiable-Systems-Group (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, routing via wouter in client/src/App.tsx).

Goal for this checkpoint

Bring the **Home / Overview page (root route "/")** fully in line with VSG Brand & Voice System v3.0 and the Truth · Capital · Dignity model.

The page should clearly communicate:
- Who VSG is (AI-native, cryptography-grounded venture studio),
- What we do (infrastructure for verifiable autonomy),
- Our three domains (Truth · Capital · Dignity),
- How Ventures, Approach, and Governance fit together,
- That everything runs on our own balance sheet first, non-custodial by design.

Do NOT change layout primitives, visual design, or routes. Only update text content, headings, and small local data structures in the Home/Overview page file.

---

1) Locate the Home / Overview page

Find the component used for the root route `/`, e.g.:

- `client/src/pages/Home.tsx`
- `client/src/pages/Overview.tsx`
- or whatever file is configured to render at path `/` in `client/src/App.tsx`.

All changes below apply **only** inside this Home/Overview page file.

---

2) Update the hero section

Keep the existing hero JSX and classes (overline, h1, paragraph, background, CTAs). Replace only the text.

- Overline:
  "Verifiable Systems Group"

- Heading:
  "Infrastructure for verifiable autonomy."

- Body paragraph:
  "You shouldn’t have to surrender control for leverage. Verifiable Systems Group is an AI-native, cryptography-grounded venture studio that builds systems for capital, identity, and intelligence—run on our own balance sheet first across Truth, Capital, and Dignity."

(Use this as a single paragraph; if your component expects multiple <p> tags, split at the second sentence.)

Hero CTAs:

- Primary CTA label:
  "Explore our ventures"
  → Link to `/ventures` (or keep the existing href if it already points there).

- Secondary CTA label:
  "How we work"
  → Link to `/approach` (or keep the existing href if it already points to your approach/process overview).

Keep all existing button components and styling; only update labels and hrefs if needed.

---

3) Add or update the “Three domains” strip

Right below the hero (or in the first content section), add or refine a three-column/three-card strip that introduces Truth, Capital, and Dignity. Reuse your existing card/grid components.

Section heading:
  "Three domains, one studio"

Short intro paragraph:
  "Every venture we run is anchored in one of three domains—Truth, Capital, or Dignity. Together they describe what must hold, what must survive, and who must be protected."

Three cards:

1) Title: "Truth"
   Text:
   "Does this system rest on evidence solid enough to depend on? Truth is about making key decisions inspectable instead of opaque."

2) Title: "Capital"
   Text:
   "Can capital move through this system without hidden downside? Capital is about making assets work without handing over the keys."

3) Title: "Dignity"
   Text:
   "Does this system protect people’s personhood and time? Dignity is about proving presence and rights without forcing exposure."

Use the same typography and spacing patterns as other three-card sections (e.g., the Ventures index or Approach page).

---

4) Ventures highlight section

Add or update a section that briefly showcases the three ventures with domain tags, linking into the full Ventures pages.

Section heading:
  "Where we prove the rails"

Body paragraph:
  "We do not stop at slideware. Helios, Lumina, and Uniqueness Engine are where we run our ideas under real conditions, using our own balance sheet first."

Then use a three-card row (or your existing “venture cards”) with concise copy:

- Card 1:
  - Eyebrow / pill:
    "Helios · Capital"
  - Title:
    "Resilient capital engine."
  - Body:
    "Routes VSG’s own digital asset treasury under explicit limits so capital can work without surrendering control."
  - Link:
    Existing Helios detail route (e.g., `/ventures/helios`).

- Card 2:
  - Eyebrow / pill:
    "Lumina · Truth"
  - Title:
    "Physics-aware grading."
  - Body:
    "Turns card condition into evidence-backed grading signals so decisions rest on measurable inputs, not guesswork."
  - Link:
    Existing Lumina detail route (e.g., `/ventures/lumina`).

- Card 3:
  - Eyebrow / pill:
    "Uniqueness Engine · Dignity"
  - Title:
    "Personhood without exposure."
  - Body:
    "Proves one person is present without forcing them to hand over their life story, raising the cost of bots and duplicates."
  - Link:
    Existing Uniqueness detail route (e.g., `/ventures/uniqueness`).

Keep styling, layout, and card components intact; only update text and href.

---

5) Approach preview section

Add or update a section that previews the Approach/Process content without repeating the full six-stage page.

Section heading:
  "How we design and prove systems"

Body paragraph:
  "Before we call anything real, it moves through a six-stage path: Define, Validate, Build, Deploy, Evolve, and Recurse. Each stage is designed to surface risk early, keep capital within guardrails, and make sure lessons compound instead of resetting."

Below this, include a simple inline link or small button:

- Label:
  "See the six stages"
- href:
  `/process` (or the route used for your Process page).

Optionally, include a short three-bullet list under the paragraph if your layout supports it:

- "Start with boundary conditions and reasons not to build."
- "Test assumptions in controlled experiments before scaling exposure."
- "Treat every incident as a lesson fed back into our standards."

---

6) Governance preview section

Add or update a section that previews Governance/Standards without exposing internals.

Section heading:
  "Governance baked in"

Body paragraph:
  "We treat serious launches as governed experiments, not one-off bets. That means defined scope, explicit limits, named stewards, and observability from day one."

Inline link or small button:

- Label:
  "Review our standards"
- href:
  `/standards` (or your Governance/Standards route).

Keep this section short and formal—no hype language.

---

7) Insights preview section

Add or update a simple section that points to Insights/Notes.

Section heading:
  "From post-mortems to patterns"

Body paragraph:
  "When something breaks—or works better than expected—we document it. Insights are where we turn incidents, experiments, and observations into patterns we can reuse and improve."

Inline link or small button:

- Label:
  "Read insights"
- href:
  `/insights`.

Re-use your existing CTA/link component; only update text and href.

---

8) Hygiene & brand checks for this file

In the Home/Overview page file only:

- Ensure there are **no** occurrences of:
  - "Signal / Value / Human"
  - "validate the signal"
  - "AI-powered platform", "revolutionary AI", "AI magic", "game-changing agents"
  - "move fast and break things"
  - "monetize users", "harvest data"
  - "StackMe", "Stackme Holdings", or "VSP" as active brand names
  - generic “the human” phrasing (use “people”, “participants”, “personhood”, or “dignity” instead)

- Ensure the page clearly reinforces:
  - VSG as an AI-native, cryptography-grounded venture studio.
  - The line: “Infrastructure for verifiable autonomy.” (hero heading).
  - Truth, Capital, and Dignity as the three domains.
  - Ventures (Helios, Lumina, Uniqueness Engine) as proofs.
  - Balance-sheet-first, non-custodial stance (without naming protocols, banks, or tickers).

Do not touch other pages or routes in this checkpoint.
