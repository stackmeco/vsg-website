Project: Verifiable-Systems-Group (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, routing via wouter in client/src/App.tsx).

Goal for this checkpoint

Bring the **Uniqueness Engine venture detail page** fully in line with:

- VSG Brand & Voice System v3.0
- The Truth · Capital · Dignity model
- The Architect/Judge voice (precise, infrastructural, low-hype)
- The AI-native, internal-first, non-custodial stance

This page should:

- Present Uniqueness Engine as **personhood infrastructure**, not a surveillance ID product.
- Emphasize “personhood without exposure”: uniqueness, not over-collection.
- Show clearly how it maps to **Truth, Capital, and especially Dignity**.
- Explain how AI is used (patterning, fraud signals) without creepiness or “AI magic”.
- State clearly what it is and is not (no promises about compliance; not a replacement for required KYC).
- Connect to `/ventures`, `/process`, `/standards`, and `/insights`.

Do NOT change global theming, layout primitives, or add/remove routes. Only update text content, labels, and any local data structures in the **Uniqueness Engine page** file.

--------------------------------------------------
1) Locate the Uniqueness Engine page
--------------------------------------------------

Find the component that renders the **Uniqueness Engine** venture route, for example:

- client/src/pages/ventures/Uniqueness.tsx
- client/src/pages/UniquenessEngine.tsx

or whichever file is mapped to `/ventures/uniqueness` (or similar) in client/src/App.tsx.

All changes below apply only inside that Uniqueness Engine page file.

--------------------------------------------------
2) Update PageMeta for Uniqueness Engine
--------------------------------------------------

If this page uses a <PageMeta> (or similar) component, update:

- title:
    "Uniqueness Engine"
- description:
    "The Uniqueness Engine is personhood infrastructure from VSG—proving one-person-one-presence without exposing people’s full identities or turning them into product."

Keep any preloadImage prop (e.g. "/hero-texture.png") unchanged.

Do not modify imports or component structure; only update the string props.

--------------------------------------------------
3) Hero section – “personhood without exposure”
--------------------------------------------------

Keep the existing hero layout (background, columns, image/texture). Replace only the text and hrefs.

Overline:
  "Uniqueness Engine · Dignity · Venture"

Main heading:
  "Personhood without exposure."

Body paragraph:
  "The Uniqueness Engine helps systems enforce one-person-one-presence without demanding full dossiers on everyone who shows up. It focuses on uniqueness, not identity—proving that a participant is a real, singular person while revealing as little as possible."

Optional secondary line (if the layout has room under the paragraph):
  "We built it after seeing how often ‘anti-fraud’ tooling became an excuse to over-collect, profile, and lock people into systems they could not meaningfully audit."

Hero CTAs:

Primary CTA:
  Label:
    "Back to ventures"
  href:
    "/ventures"

Secondary CTA (if present):
  Label:
    "Read field notes"
  href:
    "/insights"

Do not change hero layout or component types—only these strings and hrefs.

--------------------------------------------------
4) Section: “The problem Uniqueness Engine exists to solve”
--------------------------------------------------

Section heading:
  "The problem Uniqueness Engine exists to solve"

Body paragraph:
  "Most systems that try to prevent abuse—bots, multi-accounts, coordinated fraud—reach for heavy identity checks. People are asked to hand over documents, biometrics, and behavioral traces just to prove they are not an attacker. That creates new risks: over-collection, reuse of data in ways no one agreed to, and lock-in."

If the layout supports bullets, add:

- "Sybil and bot risk in systems that assume one-person-one-presence."
- "Identity checks that collect far more data than the risk actually requires."
- "People losing control over how, where, and how long their data is used."

Closing sentence:

  "The Uniqueness Engine exists to separate uniqueness from exposure—so systems can enforce basic protections without turning people into raw material."

--------------------------------------------------
5) Section: “What the Uniqueness Engine is”
--------------------------------------------------

Section heading:
  "What the Uniqueness Engine is"

Intro paragraph:
  "The Uniqueness Engine is infrastructure for proving that a participant is a unique person in a given context, under clear constraints, without becoming a surveillance system. It focuses on the rails that connect event-level checks to higher-level guarantees."

Then use three cards or list items (reuse existing card/column components):

Card 1:
  Title:
    "Uniqueness, not biography"
  Text:
    "The system cares about whether someone is a single, real participant—not about their full life story. Where possible, it works with derived proofs or attributes instead of raw documents."

Card 2:
  Title:
    "Context-bound proofs"
  Text:
    "Proofs are bound to specific contexts and purposes, with clear limits on reuse. Being unique in one network does not silently become a global identifier."

Card 3:
  Title:
    "Infrastructure role"
  Text:
    "The Uniqueness Engine is meant to plug into access control, voting, and allocation flows as a source of personhood signals—not as a stand-alone social network or data broker."

--------------------------------------------------
6) Section: “Uniqueness Engine under Truth, Capital, and Dignity”
--------------------------------------------------

Section heading:
  "Uniqueness Engine under Truth, Capital, and Dignity"

Short intro:
  "We apply the same three questions here that we apply across the studio."

Use three cards/columns:

Card: Truth
  Title:
    "Truth"
  Text:
    "The system produces claims that can be checked: what was asserted, in which context, under which rules. Stewards can see when and how uniqueness checks were performed without seeing more about people than is necessary."

Card: Capital
  Title:
    "Capital"
  Text:
    "Many capital flows depend on fair participation and resistance to abuse. By reducing fake or repeated identities, the Uniqueness Engine helps systems allocate resources more fairly without defaulting to heavy-handed identity programs."

Card: Dignity
  Title:
    "Dignity"
  Text:
    "People should not have to surrender their entire identity to prove they are real. The Uniqueness Engine is designed to minimize exposure and give participants a say in which attributes are revealed, where, and for how long."

Keep each card to 2–3 lines of text on desktop.

--------------------------------------------------
7) Section: “How the Uniqueness Engine uses AI”
--------------------------------------------------

Section heading:
  "How the Uniqueness Engine uses AI"

Body paragraph:
  "The Uniqueness Engine is AI-native, but AI does not get to decide who counts as a person in a vacuum. Machine intelligence helps spot patterns and edge cases; humans define the rules, thresholds, and escalation paths."

Use three short items:

Item 1:
  Title:
    "Pattern detection"
  Text:
    "Models help spot abnormal patterns—repeated attempts, suspicious clusters, or behaviors that suggest automation—so stewards can tighten rules where needed."

Item 2:
  Title:
    "Risk scoring under constraints"
  Text:
    "AI can suggest risk scores and recommended actions, but those outputs are bounded by policies that define what the system may and may not do with participants."

Item 3:
  Title:
    "Escalation, not judgment"
  Text:
    "AI can flag and prioritize cases; it cannot unilaterally exclude someone. Critical decisions remain interceptable and reviewable by humans, with logs for why a flag was raised."

Avoid language like “AI takes care of everything” or “AI decides”; keep the emphasis on constrained assistance.

--------------------------------------------------
8) Section: “What the Uniqueness Engine is / is not”
--------------------------------------------------

Section heading:
  "What the Uniqueness Engine is / is not"

Use a two-column pattern if available.

Left column — “The Uniqueness Engine is”:

- "Infrastructure for enforcing one-person-one-presence in governed systems."
- "A way to connect uniqueness checks to concrete policies without exposing full identities."
- "A tool we run and test on our own projects before considering any broader use."

Right column — “The Uniqueness Engine is not”:

- "Not a public identity database or social profile system."
- "Not a replacement for legal or regulatory identity checks where those are required."
- "Not a tool for bypassing sanctions, KYC, or other compliance obligations."

Below the columns, add a muted disclaimer line:

  "This page describes infrastructure we design and test in our own environments. It is not legal, compliance, or regulatory advice."

--------------------------------------------------
9) Section: “Where the Uniqueness Engine sits in the broader studio”
--------------------------------------------------

Section heading:
  "Where the Uniqueness Engine sits in the broader studio"

Body paragraph:
  "The Uniqueness Engine is our primary answer to the Dignity question: how people participate in systems without becoming product. It works alongside ventures focused on Truth and Capital so that evidence, flows, and personhood are all treated as first-class concerns."

Optional short list referencing other ventures:

- "Truth · Lumina — physics-aware grading infrastructure."
- "Capital · Helios — constraint-aware treasury execution."
- "Dignity · Uniqueness Engine — personhood without exposure."

Below this, reuse existing link / CTA components:

- Label:
    "Explore all ventures"
  href:
    "/ventures"

- Label:
    "Review our approach"
  href:
    "/approach"

--------------------------------------------------
10) Bottom “Next steps” / CTA block
--------------------------------------------------

At the bottom of the Uniqueness Engine page (above the footer), add a “next steps” block using the shared pattern you used for Helios and Lumina.

If using <NextStepBlock>, configure approximately as:

  <NextStepBlock
    nextPage="Standards"
    description="See the standards and guardrails that shape how personhood infrastructure like the Uniqueness Engine is designed and operated."
    href="/standards"
  />

If the page already has a CTA component, keep the component and layout but update:

- Title/label:
    "Review our standards"
- Description:
    "Understand the constraints systems like the Uniqueness Engine must clear before they touch real participants."
- href:
    "/standards"

--------------------------------------------------
11) Hygiene & brand checks for the Uniqueness Engine page
--------------------------------------------------

In this page file only, ensure:

1) There are **no** occurrences of:
   - The old domains "Signal", "Value", "Human" as domain names.
   - The phrase "validate the signal".
   - Phrases like "AI-powered platform", "revolutionary AI", "AI magic", "game-changing agents".
   - "move fast and break things".
   - "StackMe", "Stackme Holdings", "Stackme app", or "VSP" as active brand names.
   - The phrase "the human" used as a noun by itself. Prefer: "people", "participants", "personhood", or "dignity".

2) You do **not**:
   - Mention specific identity / proof-of-personhood competitors or protocols by name.
   - Suggest that this system can or should be used to circumvent regulatory requirements.
   - Promise absolute protection against fraud, bots, or abuse.

3) You **do**:
   - Clearly articulate “personhood without exposure” as the core idea.
   - Tie Uniqueness Engine explicitly to Dignity, with clear references to Truth and Capital.
   - Emphasize AI-native, constraint-aware, internal-first operation.
   - Maintain the Architect/Judge voice: calm, exact, ethically explicit, with at most 1–2 “you shouldn’t have to…” or similar warmth lines on the page.

Do not modify other pages or routes in this checkpoint.
